And I think someday I will figure out a way to make sure I don‚Äôt fail. It‚Äôs too hard. Every time I try and get myself to a point where I‚Äôm close to being happy, I‚Äôm pushed into something terrible. As if I don‚Äôt deserve to be happy ever and I should be punished for thinking I ever could. I know that there are people worse off , maybe I‚Äôm always too dramatic. I just feel alone all the time and I‚Äôm just waiting to get through the day. 

When I was younger, I used to think it was so easy to suicide and it was a cheat code people used because they couldn‚Äôt handle life. But it‚Äôs as difficult as living. The only difference is that you only have to do it once. 

I don‚Äôt want to post this because I feel as though the things I said might trigger someone else. But I think if I don‚Äôt tell someone about the way I feel, I might actually sit down and figure out a way to do it. 

Everyone expects me to be cold, unemotional and logical all the time. I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I‚Äôve had bouts where I couldn‚Äôt even do basic tasks like getting out of bed. But then I slowly got myself out and I thought I had escaped that. Even at that point, which I thought back then was my lowest, I never thought about suicide as much as I do now.

A few months ago, a phrase which said ‚Äúyou can get off this ride at any time you want‚Äù came to me. For some reason at that time it gave me a lot of comfort. I could end it if it‚Äôs too hard. But now it‚Äôs all I think about. This isn‚Äôt who I want to be.",1.0,2.0,0.0,2.0

I have kids, so I would never kill myself...but, fuck...if a car was plowing towards me I don't think I'd be quick to move out of the way.

In the NIN song Eraser where Trent screams out ""erase me"" before ""kill me"", man I feel that ""erase me"" to my core. There is that deep begging in his voice for someone to do it, and that's 100% where I'm at rn.

I was messaging my partner just before saying that I couldn't get to sleep (forgot to get new night time meds, which are my neuro &amp; depression meds) and mentioned that I was down, and he went from replying straight away to nothing, and now he's asleep on the couch (the little one is in bed with me). It just made me feel so alone. Like vastly alone. I feel so guilty because I'm reading posts from those of you who have no one, literally no one, in your lives that you can turn to or who love you. One would think that I'd be 100% content, but I'm not. I'm fucking drowning here, man. I'm falling in this deep fucking abyss and it's scary in here, and I just want out.",1.0,2.0,0.0,2.0
7,t3_yqprxe,depression,My new partner has depression - how can I help?,"I (25 F) recently started dating a guy (25 M) a few months ago whom I adore. But just the past month he‚Äôs started to get really depressed. I knew he had depression when we first started talking and I knew it got worse in the winter. I‚Äôve struggled with depression myself in the past so I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal to be there with him through an episode. 

I hate admitting it but it‚Äôs been really hard. When he‚Äôs depressed he‚Äôs a completely different person from the guy I fell so hard for. He is so irritable and withdrawn. I can‚Äôt do anything to help him feel better and I genuinely feel like he hates me and wants nothing to do with me. He occasionally tells me it‚Äôs not about me and he‚Äôd prefer to have me around when he‚Äôs feeling bad. 

I try just being there with him. Not saying anything or interacting with him. But I feel so insecure and anxious. I crave reassurance from him that he still wants me and he‚Äôs just not in the place to give it. Even when he‚Äôs in a good mood I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells because it seems the littlest thing will irritate him or send him spiraling. It‚Äôs so hard for me to just sit there while he‚Äôs feeling like shit. It doesn‚Äôt help that we‚Äôre both in a very intense graduate school program, exhausted all the time, and with so little free time. 

I really love this person and I want to be there for him through this. It‚Äôs just been so hard. I hate to say it but I start to have doubts about if the best partner for him. Maybe somebody else would say and do all the right things and make it better.

9,t3_yqppw2,depression,I don't know if im depressed but I just never want to wake up again.,"Im so tired of life. I've felt this way for years despite how young I am. I don't exactly remember how it started, I just remember thinking I just wanna stay and disappear into my bed. Going to school and going outside became a chore. All I ever want to do is lay in bed watch youtube videos, play games and talk to people online. It's just so much easier online as they know nothing about who you are what you've been throught and what you look like. I can be free of worries, I don't have to worry about how they think of me and how they react to my jokes as it can't affect me and my daily life. I've been avoiding going to school I just can't be bothered to, this feeling of not wanting to do anything just won't go away. The fact I recently started highschool with people I don't know and can't relate to doesn't help. It sucks at that school it feels like everyone there are extroverts with them all being confident and can talk to anyone. Whenever im in a situation where a lot of people are talking I usually just shut up if I don't really know them well. What's making it even worse is most times when I do talk I get ignored ""maybe I just talk to quietly?"". 
I've gone to that school for about 3 months now and I still don't have anyone I can call a friend I of course have tried it's just so hard when I don't relate to them or understand what they are talking about. This has made me even more reluctant to go there and I usually make excuses to not go. The feeling doesn't stop there it even makes me not wanna go to my job either which upsets my whole family causing us to argue a lot. I just can't help the feeling of never wanting to do anything but stay in my room. My family always says the only thing I care about is my computer and food, and it's true! Those things are the only things that makes me happy how could i not care about them?
My family keeps asking me why I don't wanna go to school and to work. I never respond thought seeing their sad and worried faces would make me feel even worse I would rather die than tell them upfront as then I atleast wouldn't se their faces. Maybe it isn't even that I have always had a hard time opening up I just prefer shutting up just makes it so much easier. I've also been having more violent dreams recently I don't know if it is a sign or not? Maybe my subconscious is telling me to die. I mean I would do it I was even about to 4 years ago unfortunately I chickened out im just to scared of pain, what a coward I know. If someone gave me a pill that would kill me instantly I would take it, I just can't stand arguing with my family every week. 
Im sorry this became so long I just really had to get it out of my chest to someone not close to me.
I know it's just me venting, ill se if I can muster up the courage to finally end it all, maybe then ill finally be happy? maybe then my family can stop worrying about me? Im just sad I won't be able to continue playing games lol.

I've not even made it to a 1st Interview yet. Its making me super depressed and wondering if I'm ever going to be hired in a job like that again (It was a laid back web dev job). 

I hate hate hate hate HATE talking to my recruiter about always being eager and happy when talking on the interviews. It feels so disingenuous, because I'm NOT happy. I'm NOT eager.

19,t3_yqnccw,depression,How do I stop feeling so insignificant?,"I'm a shell of my former self. Earlier this year I went though a terrible breakup. It hurts even 6 months later. This was a woman I thought I was going to marry. I thought that after only a month of us dating. But 2.5 years later we separated. It's true that in our inciting argument I stated I didn't want to marry her in that moment... we had been going through some troubled times. I wish I had clarified that it's because I wanted us to work on our issues first...but I didn't. So now I spend 1-3 nights a week feeling like shit, pining over her, wishing she were mine again, and even regretting my words in that conversation at times. That I would have do anything to get her back in my life...the way she used to be. Ohh... and here's the kicker. She's still part of my friend group. I still see her on almost a weekly basis. She's been in a new relationship for the last 5 months though, but thankfully she's not brought the guy into the social circle, but it's honestly only a matter of time. I've only been on a few dates. But I just can't get over her and keep ending things because of that fact. It's not fair to them to stay if I'm not 100% committed.

To get to the point of this... after the breakup I fell into a pretty big depressive period. Seeing her so often hurts. Seeing other communicate with her on a casual level hurts. When she and I happen to talk  it's so distant. It's so fragmented. It feels... foreign. I feel insignificant. To know she's already completely moved on while I can't just hurts. She literally is my ""one who got away"". But... I can't ask her to leave the friend group now... She's too well ingrained and I don't want to do that as well. I have to somehow learn to be okay with things as they are. I realize I've taken a hard path. But I continue to fail... to retract myself from others.

I've isolated from my friends, I've used far too much porn as a coping skill, I've stopped doing anything outside of playing video games or binging shows. I work from home and find there are times where I don't leave my apartment for an entire week. I'm just floating through life. But I'm so so tired of just floating. Of feeling like I don't matter. But everything I try I end up stopping. Most things I plan I end up canceling. Why can't I get past this? I've never once considered physical harm... I know life will eventually improve. But I can't seem to find my way out of this. I just disassociate, turn my brain off, and disappear. Motivation to do anything else is just...gone.

But screw that. I want out. I want to move forward. It hurts, but I can't live in the past. But... how do I move forward? I've tried journaling...I've tried being more social... I tried anti-depressants... I've tried so many things. But I'm constantly anxious now. Around friends, family, strangers. I feel like I'm always out of place. 

To be honest, I don't want to date until I feel better about myself. I just don't want to fall into a situation where all my happiness is derived from someone else. But damn.. I'm so starved of affection that I feel pain. Even from friends... I honestly feel like a lot of them have just disappeared...but I realize they aren't just going to reach out out of the blue...  I need to actually DO something, REACH OUT to them, CALL them...

I suppose this post is just me venting about stuff. I feel like I'm all over the place... but I do have a couple questions you could help answer.

1. How do you rejoin society after periods of isolation?
2. How do you reignite passions?
3. Did you find support from anyone? Friends, Family? Online Forums? Somewhere else?
4. Any books you can recommend? 
5. How do you get over a traumatic breakup?",1.0,3.0,0.0,3.0

I don't even why I'm bothering to post this but lately, I've felt like shit. It feels like everything is going downhill for me. My probation got extended, my friend I haven't seen since grade school is a mass murderer and facing life in prison, I don't have the energy to make music anymore, I live in a shitty group home thousands of miles away from the house I used to live in (which has been sold and probably flattened). My parents don't want me to come home because I'm not straight/cisgender or whatever and I have a headache 24/7. I don't even know why I bother getting out of bed. My nightmares are so bad lately and the addictions that I managed to kick are coming back. I tried so hard to turn my life around but ended up a fucking addicted loser with abusive tendencies toward those who mean the most to me. I've been single since 2019 when my girlfriend dumped me (for good reason). At first, I blamed her and titled her the bad guy but I cheated on her multiple times, lied, and manipulated her into abandoning her friends and responsibilities just because I was a little bit sad. I was told that recognizing my faults and mistakes would help me move on but being aware of my behavior in the past isn't helping me change anything. I can't even bother to eat, everything tastes like ash. I used to be suicidal but that wouldn't solve or change what I've done so I just kinda will myself to trudge forward as this is my retribution for the way I have treated others. I made them suffer, therefore I must suffer. It seems kinda edgy and attention-seeking but I don't really have any other way to motivate myself to do anything other than telling myself that I deserve it.   


I was diagnosed with adhd when I was a little kid but now I've got a whole arsenal of acronyms that mean absolutely nothing because it all blends together. OCD, SBD, REMSBD, SWS, ADHD, MDD, ABED, etc. Not to mention the gender/orientation dysphoria and other shit. I don't even care about anything anymore ig I just want something to do with my life. Im not even an adult and I already have to manage everything about myself. Nobody has really been here to parent me until its convenient for them so I ended up raising myself until I got put in foster care. everything sucks lmao.

We had a breakup 2 years ago that was largely us both being so depressed we were unable to see each other hurting . he was DX with severe depression in May. He refuses meds because of his personal beliefs. We have an 8 month old baby and I have teenagers from previous relationship. Our relationship has deteriorated to nothing. He is so miserable, negative, depressed. He has admitted to me he has intrusive thoughts. He has also admitted he is with me only for the baby. He wants to exist with me (live civilly together as co-parents) to be in the baby's life. He refuses the possibility of not being together and co-parenting while not living together. He works out of town so he's only home weekends. Here's my struggle: we are so unhappy. He's emotionally abusive to me. (I don't use that term lightly ) He is checked out of the relationship. I pay for almost everything in the household. (He makes good money - almost twice as much as I do) He pays for the vacations/dinners out/fun stuff and diapers. I feel like a single mom. Im exhausted. He doesn't help with the baby (I get up every night with her , feed, bathe, everything) I have a lot of resentment towards him because I went though depression and severe anxiety when pregnant and he was not there to support me. I understand that he doesn't recognize himself anymore because he is so deep into depression. He sits on the couch when he is home. That's about it. (Depression!) Im trying to put my hurt aside to help him but I don't know if I can. I feel awful contemplating ending the relationship for my mental health when it's his mental health that is a huge barrier in our way. My older kids see it and ask how long I'm going to put up with it, his negativity, his rudeness, his empty promises and they see that I'm raising their sister on my own.

I show way too many signs of ADHD but my mother specifically tells me I'm just lazy. For a fact, I know I have a shit ton of anxiety! I want to go far away so nobody has to deal with my selfishness and laziness anymore. We can't afford my mistakes, they shouldn't have to deal with my stupid lazy imbecilic shit. I can't deal with 60 hours of schoolwork a week. I'm not cut out for this yet. I'm just a kid....

But I know I CANNOT kill myself, because the people around me will be full of grief. The same people I fear the expectations of, the same people that told me I was lazy, the same people that gave me love, fear, anxieties....

But I‚Äôm hurting so bad, and they don‚Äôt know how painful it actually is. I‚Äôm not capable of happiness. It‚Äôs as if it‚Äôs the one emotion I was born without.

I‚Äôm so frightened of the world and everyone in it that I can‚Äôt even leave the house to go outside. Sometimes I‚Äôm able to, to find places I feel safe. But it‚Äôs very rarely that I do. I hide in my room all day writing and reading, and sometimes even then I have no power but to sit and cry and hurt myself in ways that override what I feel in my head. How long must I endure living in such hell? 

Sometimes I wish someone would just shoot me. Something quick, without warning. I wish I could kill myself -but I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know how. I hardly have the courage to step out from my bedroom let alone jump off a bridge or slit my wrists.

They weren‚Äôt even nice to me, and yet I mourn them because I have no one else. 

Something terrible is inside me and it‚Äôs pulling me away from all things good. I feel sick with the fear of night, because that‚Äôs when the voices become louder.

my parents have high expectations of me, This is because I had very high acceptance marks (SAT and AP). They want me to graduate with a high GPA in engineering in the shortest possible time, Even though they knew I was battling my depression/anxiety. I tried to explain to them that engineering is not like that and that my degree may take much longer (I don't know the ETA-for real who knows what the future holds :SMH: -).

So I proposed another solution: changing to a simpler major/subject and a simpler university. They replied that I am a huge disappointment to the family And that I should live on my own without them caring for me anymore.

By the way, I work hard to maintain a good GPA and meet their expectations, but last year I slept all day because I was depressed/anxious (btw they kept holding therapy and tuition costs over my head). As a result, I am at least a year behind my peers.

 So idk how to start but I have a lot of mental issues. I have ptsd, depression, anxiety, bipolar. I have more but those bother me the most. So I am young I'm 18, but I am so lost and on the edge. My brain is everywhere after everything that has happened in the last few months. So my life has always been full of mental problems, but I can usually deal with it because it is just some small things or just 1 thing that is truly bothering me, but this time it's worse. So I was with this girl and everything was literally perfect. Things could not have been better. We were in love and doing great. Then everything changed after we graduated. We could not see each other nearly as much. So we were both working full time. So not being able to see her sucked but I could deal with it we powered through it. Then we both started college. That made things infinitely worse. I started rough but it was okay. So we were in school, and so ofc we could still barely see each other. So I got super fucking depressed because my mom is dealing with post partum depression because she just had a baby so that was getting to me, doing almost nothing but working or school was getting to me, and not being able to see her hurt me as well. So we started having a lot of issues. We argued more than we ever had. Then the dumbest shit started with her. So if she had a bad day we would call or text and talk about it. I would walk her through it and would help her with the shit that was bothering her. And giving her other things to focus her mind on. But when I had a bad day or was having a bad time. She practically ignored me. She would just say ""oh it's okay. Oh it will be okay Aden"" ""It is always okay"". She cared so little for me mentally that it was crazy. So we argue and talk and what not then we break up. Within a few days she begs for me back and I take her back. It goes well then a week or 2 later she left me again. I said okay and was going to get back on medication, and back into therapy so I was just gonna figure it out. She does the same shit and begs for me back comes over to my house at 2 in the morning hyperventilating, and can barely talk. And when she does finally talk she tells me that she loves me and will do anything to keep me. So we get back together. Things are yet again great. Then one day she wasn't having a great day and got kind of dry with me, but I was just like well shit happens. So after about 3 days I ask her about it and say I don't like her not talking to me about what is wrong. Long story short after a like 2 day argument. We break up again. This time it was for real. But we were still friends and cool. She still came over and what not so we basically acted like a couple just without saying it. Then one day she texts me and says she wants to come over. So she does. We chill, have sex, and just talk. She cries telling me she loves me and that she just wants me to be better. And that she is happy alone but would be way happier with me. So after chilling for a bit she goes home. So the next day we are talking. And she tells me she is hanging out with one of her guy friends. I was cool with it I knew about him so I didn't care. Bit she didn't tell me anything off rip she just told me that she was hanging out with someone. She ignored my questions and said because we aren't together she doesn't have to tell me anything. But. There were 3 questions and they were fair and simple. Where she was going. Who she was with. Then after just tell me how it went. That is it. So after all that she goes and hangs out with him and his friends. Girls and guys. She at the end said she was going home, and was close to her house. So an hour later I text her like her you should be home what are you doing and where are you. Yk are you okay what's up. She says she is finally in tville. So I was like okay what happened. Then she just gets home and tells me I acted irrationally and that she couldn't do it. And that she didn't want to be friends. And now her and that guy are together. Idk what else to say.

The pay is great for what I do, my Supervisor is so caring and laid back, and best of all I get to work from home which has been great for my introverted self. 

Yesterday about 300 other people within the company and I were told that we will be laid off at the end of November due to rising costs and inflation and shit. It was just so sudden‚Äîand although I am grateful for the severance package they are providing (about 3 months of pay) and that I wasn‚Äôt let go immediately, I‚Äôve felt so much panic, confusion, anxiety, and depression. 

I know other people have been fired and laid off multiple times and got through it. I just feel so weak and have been crying profusely or feeling completely numb‚ÄîI‚Äôve been going back and forth waiting for more random tears to just hit me out of no where.

My partner and I live together and only have one car that we share (can‚Äôt afford another right now) and so I either have work out a driving schedule with him or get another job working from home, which has given me even more anxiety and hopelessness.

My goal is to get right with god and then kill myself because  i cant do this for much longer. Dont you dare say ""it gets better"" because it doesnt.

Everyone has said they at least had 1 friend or someone to talk to but i have nothing. Im 16, have no father. He is a horrible person and abused me now hes in jail. I have no mother figure, she doesnt care about me at all. I ask her for help about my life, my mental health, etc.. I could tell her i was feeling sad and shed say ""get over it"" ""shut the fuck up i dont have time for your overly sensitive ass"" or ""wtf do you want me to do about it"". 

For a long time theres been a growing emptiness in me. Its so bad. My heart physically hurts with sadness, i cry everyday, i try so hard . I really do. there is no way out of this situation and living doesn't even seem worth it anymore. All 16 years of my life have been nonstop horror. If you could read my mind you would be in tears.

sh and mentions of suicidal thoughts ‚ö†Ô∏è 
Hey, So I have a problem. Let‚Äôs start from the beginning. Im a F15 and I have let‚Äôs just say I have  strict parents. They are both Christian both homophobic and also racist and my dad is locally ‚Äúfamous‚Äù. So basically I struggle with a lot of issues like self harm suicidal thoughts (which can get pretty heavy) and anxiety, depression, social anxiety, not having any idea who I am and just not having a sense of self. But here‚Äôs my problem I‚Äôve been telling my parents for a long time that I have been cutting myself and had some suicidal thoughts. But i was usually just told ‚Äúthink positive thoughts‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok sweetie‚Äù stuff like that. Also I should probably add that school is extremely mentally draining for me and going to school will either end in me crying in the bathroom or just leaving early faking a stomach cramp (even tho I actually have consistent stomach pains) just to get out of school because my parents don‚Äôt understand at all. They also don‚Äôt seem to listen, and they seem to think that changing schools to a private Christian school is going to fix all my problems. After I told them I no longer believe in god or what the bible teaches. I also have a lot of trauma from my dad just being an asshole. I‚Äôve been screamed at and I mean screamed at for my French grade in grade 9 I only got a c-. He told me I basically failed and how I ‚Äúlied‚Äù to him after all I did was suggest that maybe me not handing in this certain thing could have brought my grade down, I even had to sit on a plane with him for 5 hours afterwards. Another thing he‚Äôs done is I was not aloud to close my door for about 4 months unless I was getting changed. (Shocked he didn‚Äôt take the door off the hinges) but the thing with the punishment is, is that I didn‚Äôt do anything to get the punishment in the first place there was no reason for him not to trust me. I‚Äôve never drank alcohol, hung out with boys, smoked, vaped, snuck out, I haven‚Äôt even kissed someone for god sake. Yet he still won‚Äôt trust me. I‚Äôm not even aloud an ounce of social media. But my point is, is that I need some advice on how to communicate to my parents that they are the problem (even tho they pretty well know already) and get them to actually understand that I have a mental illness and that this is something they need to understand and take seriously without them being overly worried and making me feel guilty for telling them this and how they make it feel like it‚Äôs all my fault and that I should feel bad for feeling this way. As well as saying things like ‚Äúwhere did my little girl go‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs happening to u‚Äù. I just need to know what to tell them because I don‚Äôt want them up my ass asking if I‚Äôm anxious over homework. Because don‚Äôt get me wrong homework doesn‚Äôt help but that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm depressed and I don‚Äôt always have to have a reason for being depressed. As well as getting them to understand that being up stairs (instead of in my room in the basement)(my safe place) is not a great place for me to be because it‚Äôs loud and my whole families up there my dad my mom and my 3 sisters, and I go there almost all hours of the day to get away from them. Lots of people like to blame my parents behaviour on there age because my dad is 58 and my mom is 50 so they aren‚Äôt young especially since they have 9 year old twin daughters. But my point is (I‚Äôm sorry for rambling I‚Äôm getting there) I need someone to tell me how I‚Äôm supposed to talk to them without A. them being on my ass about school and me changing schools and B.  having them worry and make me feel guilty about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep lying to myself and its tearing me apart inside. I've never been the happiest since my mom since a young age expected perfect grades since she saw that I was actually able to keep them high unlike my other brothers. I would hold myself together by telling myself that I had good grades and distracting myself, but i could never shake the disappointment I always felt when I did something wrong or when someone yelled at me for messing up. I started feeling really down and hollow since it felt like i did the same things every day, but when i would look up what was wrong with me I kept telling myself that i was being dramatic and I was being a burden. I think what really started me feeling like crap all the time was when I learned that I was an accident, and if i wasn't born my mom wouldn't have to work as much and could save money for later since shes older. Other then getting mad and yelling or hitting me when i got bad grades, my mom considers me lazy and insults me for things like being annoying or quiet, or yells at me when i mess up. I also have my siblings and my step-dad who ironically is one of the reasons why i cant let myself leave, including my brothers and my friends. I can occasionally get along with my sister but I still don't get her always focusing on college and what will happen in the long run, forgetting about the things I want to do and how i want to spend my time first. My mom isn't terrible to me, but I feel like a burden to her, and my family and friends since I don't speak like I used to since I was called annoying or frustrating. I spend most of my time trying to not mess up, and it kills me when I do since the last thing i want to do is make people angry with me, but when im not and alone I usually cant think of anything but static since I hate listening to myself sometimes. What i mean by the title is I keep telling myself one day, sooner or later i'll get a break, I'll be able to be what i want to be, I'll be helping everyone and meeting their expectations, I'll find someone who gets who I am. But now all i do is screw up, disappoint, which makes me realize how much of a disappointment I am. I'm genuinely not sure why I cant be grateful since there's a lot of good things that've happened to me, and even right now I feel like im going to be wasting peoples input on what i'm going through since others have it so much worse. But I dont think I cant take much more of feeling like shit all the time, and I cant leave because I'd hurt the people I care about too much. I've been cutting down on eating recently and I cry most nights when I start to think about how badly i screw up and how crappy of a person I am, but I never show anyone. I have cracked a few times but they never got past surface level, and I want to keep it that way. No one knows other then the people who read this which wont be anyone I know personally.

this is my second day without using cannabis. it's also my second day on the keto diet...

I find yesterday was very difficult to sleep and I know it will be like that for a while... I managed to go a month without smoking pot but I relapsed. (Vivid and awful dreams the first time i tried to quit) i know it's normal ... 

I decided to quit smoking because I'm fat and I suffer from binge eating and the two addiction are connected (i smoke to enjoy food and feel some comfort and escape reality) , I also have polycystic ovary syndrome so my hormones are hard to control (that's why i'm on keto diet)...I got out of a long relationship few years ago and I used weed to help me with the breakup and I have been addicted since ... I prefer to smoke at home quiet and refuse every plan that is offered to me, I have difficulties in several spheres of my life at the moment and smoking allowed me to escape, i don't enjoy the things i used to enjoy.

I feel so sad and discourage tonight, i feel like I don't matter too much for others, I'm not anyone's priority and I feel so unimportant to anyone. I am also on ritalin for ADHD and wellbutrin + Lexapro for anxiety/depression ...

So a bit of backstory I have been struggling with depression for almost 3 years now. I have been on medication for the majority of this time which allows me to get out of bed.

This past year I met my best friend and love of my life. She has made me feel so loved and cared for every minute we have been together. But depression and crippling anxiety are a bitch.

Lately I've been having vivid nightmares about her. About us no longer being together etc etc. Which has caused our relationship to deteriorate. I have said and done things during our time together that has upset her and caused me to simply just think how much better off she would be without me and how I don't deserve her. 

My self destructiveness and needyness has gotten worse and worse until today my girlfriend informed me that I had upset her so much I broke down completely. Heart palpitations, it felt like I had pins and needles in my teeth, I was screaming and crying all at the same time without any control over it. Just repeatedly saying how sorry I am for everything, explaining how I always feel I fuck everything up in life and how I'm terrified of losing her even tho I think she would be so much better off without me.

Long story short once we seperated she told me she loves me and needs a few days apart physically to work on her own health and for me to work on my own. I love her so much I really do. I have lost so many people throughout my life mainly due to my own self destructiveness. I can't let this happen with her. I have nobody else, I have ran out of options for seeking help. I can't afford therapy. I spend every morning trying to get out of bed, I can't eat or sleep and the tablets just aren't working anymore.

I was having a great time and finally got my first girlfriend. She was fun, gorgeous, and we had a great time together. I was in college getting a STEM degree and was on my way to a successful career. Life was great.

A few weeks into our relationship, I contracted herpes (HSV-2). She didn't know she had it, but that didn't make a different. My self-esteem was crushed overnight. The relationship broke down and I resented her. We fought constantly. Eventually, the relationship ended after a crazy year. 

I was still convinced that I would be single for the rest of my life. I couldn't believe this was real life. I felt disgusting and worthless. Then, to make matters even worse, I noticed that I was rapidly going bald. For someone who already had bad body image issues, this destroyed me.

Eventually, I started dating again and found that with the proper precautions (condoms and daily medication), I could date with HSV-2. That helped, but I still felt like shit about the situation. I felt like my youth had been stripped from me. I still felt disgusting, especially with the hair loss. I was too scared to take a medication like Finasteride because of the horror stories of permanent erectile dysfunction I'd heard, and after the shock of getting herpes I started to assume that the worst case situation was my destiny. 

My performance at work slipped. I avoided everyone at work. I sometimes drank in the parking lot during lunch time. 

Eventually, things got so bad that I started going out drinking and getting angry. I got arrested several times in a year span for misdemeanors. This resulted in 2 years of legal battles which fortunately were resolved for the most part. But the stress was overwhelming and I kept beating myself up for the arrests.

After all the dust settled, I'm now shaving my head and I hate it. I can't stand the way I look and I hate being in my body. I can barely get out of bed. I was able to pick up my performance at work but it's dropped again. I have extreme anxiety and trouble looking people in the eyes. I tried Brazilian jiu-jitsu for a year and still do it, but it hasn't helped with confidence. I still struggle immensely to talk to people, even those I train with.

All the self-improvement, therapy, and rehab I've tried hasn't helped much. I just want my old life back but that's never going to happen. I hate my life, I hate myself, and I truly wish I were dead. I just wish I could have had a normal life. But it's never going to happen.",1.0,3.0,0.0,3.0

212,t3_ypq40x,depression,Venting out about things,"**Crushed by Expectations**

People really had high expectations of me when I was young. They called me the second coming of my grandfather and it sucks that I failed to live up to their expectations. I can see looking at their eyes, that they don't have any faith in me anymore. The disappointing look that my father gave me after I came back from my entrance exams is still stuck with me to this day. Rather than cheering me up, he always looked at me disappointed.  

Few weeks ago, I told my parents how I was feeling ill and that I needed to get diagnosed for depression or any other mental disorder that I might have. But they simply laughed it off. When I asked my father how he felt about me, he called me ""average"". Imagine that. Not the first time I have heard it from my family members either. My cousins made a comment like that too...saying I was average. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I envy people**

I often get jealous just by seeing people happy. I feel like I deserve that too. I have always tried to be nice with everyone but nothing good happens to me. No relationships, no friends checking up on me. The people that I surround myself with aren't too nice either. I will sometimes disappear to see if they will notice, but no one does. If I have a fight, I am always the one apologizing. It feels like I am always the one trying to check on others and making sure they feel happy. Do I not deserve the same kind of treatment? 

You know I had my birthday last month. Besides my parents, only one friend got me a gift. What sucked was my so-called best friends didn't even get me anything. I'm 21 years old, why would anyone get you a gift at that age you might ask. Thing is, we all got each other gifts for each other's birthday. There were calls made discussing the gift that we should get this so-so person. But no one got me anything on my birthday. Even a pen would have worked (that's the gift that my one friend got me). 

The same people that I talked about discuss things with themselves and don't share anything with me. They don't call me or text me as much as they do each other. I feel like a ""filler friend"" here. And now people will say why don't you cut off your relationship with them? Then, who else do I have to go to? Everyone associates me with them.  I cut my previous friend group for them only for this to happen.

**Living in a small apartment**

I live in a 1 BHK flat and the doors are thin here. I don't even have my own room, I sit in the drawing room most of the time. My parents and neighbors can hear when I am talking to someone so I am not able to express myself as i am always thinking that someone is watching or listening to me. I have trouble expressing myself and I feel awful about it. My dad is retired so he stays at home too. I love him but he acts weird and says somethings that really hurts my feelings. My relationship with my cousins from his side isn't too well either.

What sucks the most about it is I can't even get therapy. I will have to attend video calls and I can't full express how I feel or vent out without thinking that they are listening to me. I'm self conscious as is. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Weight Gain/ Self Conscious about how I look** 

I have gained a lot of weight in the past 5 years because of overeating. I overeat because It helps me cope with my depression. Five years late and now the things that I eat make me feel ill. Even so, I still eat them everyday. I am very much addicted to junk food and it sucks. I would go to gym for a month or two and then cancel my membership and start eating junk food again. I think part of it is because my friends and family are enablers. My friends will invite me out to eat knowing I am dieting and then mock me and make fun of my weight later. My family members will get things from outside ""out of love"". I weigh around 81 KGs right now. I have lost some weight in the past few months but my growing addiction has lead to me gaining weight again.

Not only am I self conscious about my weight but also my face and how I look. I despise looking at the mirrors and try to avoid them as they remind me of how I look. I feel awful looking at my face and try to avoid taking pictures. These Instagram stories of friends don't help either. They look so much better, that's my thought process when I am looking at their pictures.

**Awful Jokes which made me feel uncomfortable**

I had a group of online friends, one of them being a school bully. While I was in that group, I always made fun of myself to fit in. I would belittle myself and make fun of my body. You know I was fine doing that but it got out of hand when they started calling me a pedophile. Who makes jokes about pedophilia? They did it because my school bully saw a bunch of hentai on my phone. Mind you, I was 17 at the time and I was looking at hentai of characters from My Hero Academia. 

We were once in a game with a kid who might be 11-12 years old I don't know. And they started making pedophilic jokes about me while in the game. I have never felt so uncomfortable and disgusted in my life. I felt like kms at that moment. These jokes continued for over 2 years which made me unable to talk to my nephews/nieces. The fact that I once broke down in a call with them and spent like a good 2 hours explaining them how I was mentally feeling at that time. How their jokes made me feel awful. But that didn't stop them from continuing those jokes to this day. I don't play very often with them but when I do, they always make those jokes.

I am sorry but I can't help but go back to them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Abuse** 

Imagine crying on your birthday. That happened to me more than once when I was young. My dad would had a tight grip on me and would hit me if I misbehaved. I love him and my relationship with him has gotten better over the years. He was going through a tough time then so I have forgiven him for some of the things he has done like slamming my head onto a tv. Currently, I have two loving parents who really do care about me. They have treated me well and gotten me things that I asked them to. I feel awful when I yell out swear words at them or hurt their feelings. 

I don't think I have ever said any sentence more than ""I am sorry"" and ""Thank you"". I say it out of the blue to them whenever I feel guilty. I blame myself for everything wrong that has happened and I keep asking them to forgive me. Sometimes I yell out and say hurtful things but I don't mean them. Fuck, Its hard to take back things. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why?**

&amp;#x200B;

Why do awful things happen to me? I haven't gotten diagnosed yet but I just had to vent out my feelings somewhere. I probably will continue to suffer and not get diagnosed which is fine, I have managed to live so far. I will continue living as is. Don't worry I don't have any suicidal thoughts. I have never one considered committing suicide. I want to live out my life no matter how painful it is.

I just wish I could heal from all this and be happy again. I just want to be happy. Is that too much to ask? More than any relationship, any girlfriend, I just want to be able to smile and be content with life. 

Today, I went to a doctor for my eyes check up. He made a comment about how I always look sad. That got me. Even when clicking pictures, people will tell me to smile when I am already smiling? Have I forgotten how to smile?

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Sorry for dragging this out. I just wanted to vent out somewhere. I haven't been able to share this with everyone so I wanted to remain anonymous and share this here. At least now I know that somewhere I have shared my story. If anything I can look back to this thread and see how much I have grown. Hope in 10 years, I am doing much better with my life and I can make a follow up to this. Things we imagine.

It was like a deep emotional love, very intimate even without much physical contact.
Loved her too much &lt;3.
I don't know what happened, but towards the last few weeks of our relationship it felt like i was pretending to love her.., Now looking back, that was never the case. I was tired from the same routine of texting her the same love messages. I got bored, like every human. What i didn't realise that she loved me far beyond anything i could imagine. Being the dumbass, that i am i asked to breakup with her due to some issues with her family which now seem like petty issues. I was going through this intense cycle of emotions that i took the advice from someone that i shouldn't have. They advised me to go forward with it even if she begs. Our breakup conversation lasted for days where we talked anywhere from 5-6 hours constantly trying to sort the matter. Trusting that advice i stuck to my word. I ended up losing someone who i saw a wife in. She was literally everyone's dream girl. Im not particularly attractive or ""fit"" but she never pointed it out. She was always loyal, kind and caring. I was her first love but she wasn't mine. She was the one who you hold on to and never let go. This is not the first time I've done something i regret. I'm always supercritical about my decisions but somehow they always end in someone else's favour. I'm talking about the things that actually matter. I give people advice, but i seem to be as lost as any other guy you'd find off the street. It seems like when i decide to let go of something, it becomes better and i regret it. When i decide to hold something close, it becomes worse. Either my luck is  really REALLY bad. Or I'm just disease playing innocent :(. Well time to go find a therapist üòÖ
Ever since then I've been severely depressed, just the thought of her makes my eyes tear up. Getting dreams about her every night. But they follow the same story, it's always me in some scenario or another, going up to her and asking for forgiveness and asking her to come back. It always ends the same too, she says no and i wake up in cold sweats.
I don't know if I'm a hopeless romantic or whatever but i just feel like,
Someday, somewhere I'm gonna see her again and without even realising it , I'll cry, a lot and i think she'll feel the same.
At that point, maybe, JUST maybe I'll get the love of my life back :(.

Suicide hotlines don‚Äôt help, I have not seen a therapist in nearly a decade but considering my situation they weren‚Äôt a big help then either. Maybe my problem is I just don‚Äôt plain out want to work. Which is weird, because there‚Äôs actually nothing I want to do. I kinda like games‚Ä¶ barely. I rarely play them but they are probably what makes me happy the most when it comes to entertainment unfortunately it‚Äôs not productive and brings me no money. I want to make my parents proud. I want to make my fianc√©e proud. I just don‚Äôt have it in me to change. I considered becoming a trucker. School is like $3200 and some change at my community college and I still have to learn how to drive an actual car granted never having used one. So to even begin seeing if that‚Äôs a path I want to go down, I have to making my lousy $800 every 2 weeks until I can scrape enough to fund schooling. And then what if I fail? Or don‚Äôt want to do this? I‚Äôve looked at jobs. Almost once a week. The only thing that has ever interested me is trucking or electrical work, still it‚Äôs not enough to actually go for it and change.

I‚Äôm kinda just ranting, hoping someone will hear. That‚Äôs all I can ask for as I continue to live this awful life that I created for myself. $6K in debt, in the middle of a lawsuit for something I was barely involved in. I just want to be happy. The only way I will be happy is by making my folks happy. The only way I‚Äôll make my folks happy is by not being me. 

To my fianc√©e, I love you and I‚Äôm sorry I hid the real me for months. You probably wish you could take back the investment in me and now maybe you feel it‚Äôs too late.

To my mother and father, sorry I turned out the way I did. You both tried your best. You both made sacrifices to give me a great life with opportunity and I blew it. And continue to make nothing of myself ever since. I hope one day I can change but I know it‚Äôs unlikely.",1.0,3.0,0.0,3.0

Dear Journal, 
  I finally figured out what what I want. A girl like me. I feel so alone lately. I wish for someone just like me. Who,  just like me, would cry over the small things but laugh just as hard.

The pharmacist recommended to take it in the morning so this morning I watched a ton of videos on how to swallow pills and I read a few articles on the best ways to swallow a pill and when I finally tried it I couldn't do it. I ended up choking on it and after a few minutes of trying i accidentally spit it out(I didn't mean to). Now I'm sitting here crying because it's like my body doesn't want to get better.

Topics jump between my sleeping issues to my no motivation/day to day life struggles.

Conversation came from me explaining how i feel in texts/conversation between 
bf and nana since it‚Äôs hard for me to explain on the top of my head.

‚ÄîSleeping issue‚Äî
it‚Äôs also not that i‚Äôm sleeping a lot, im sleeping less than i need to be to function bc i‚Äôm up all night meaning i haven‚Äôt slept at night or when i try i can‚Äôt, and then i‚Äôm sleeping during the day from around 11-4pm which is about 5-6 hours which i need more than 8 hours.. and i try to sleep at night i really do and my bf sees that i do try but i just can‚Äôt and idk why and i try to stay up during the day but once i start getting a headache, or i feel very tired where it‚Äôs making me paranoid or feeling like i‚Äôm going to pass out i can‚Äôt stay awake then.

i‚Äôve always struggled with sleeping at night since i was little

When i do try and sleep at night my body! My body is in pain like i don‚Äôt know how to explain it like uncomfortable/static feelings and then my back hurting

relaxing distractions to sleep don‚Äôt work, breathing exercises don‚Äôt work bc my heart beats faster than i start to focus on my heart beat

i‚Äôve taken melatonin to help sleep 4-6 100mg each?? but i wake up an hour later all the time i take it

‚Äî‚Äî-
‚ÄîIssues with day to day i guess‚Äî
i‚Äôm getting constantly onto about school and i‚Äôm just tired of it bc no one understands how hard it is for me to have motivation to do school and then me not able to understand anything brings it worse bc i want to be able to learn it and understand but i can‚Äôt so it‚Äôs just awful for me

another thing is i sometimes wonder about this but i don‚Äôt want to like self diagnose myself bc i don‚Äôt think i am bc when i look at people that are diagnosed with depression i think of someone like (friend) where she‚Äôs been suicidal, shows all of it and just has a lot of mental illness‚Ä¶ now idk if depression has like different things to it as like different levels or something but sometimes i wonder if i am but without the suicidal part or sadness and mental illness part.. idk i know i‚Äôm not lazy it may seem like i am but like once i actually do something i enjoy i‚Äôm not lazy but like when it comes to motivation, caring for myself, and feelings it‚Äôs just all not there like idk i might seem stupid saying all this but i just don‚Äôt understand 

but then isn‚Äôt depression like sadness or something i‚Äôm not like constantly sad i don‚Äôt think, like i enjoy life when it‚Äôs not to do with school or cleaning or sleeping all day. That‚Äôs why i wonder if there‚Äôs like different levels or something

https://psychcentral.com/depression/depression-without-sadness

‚Äî-‚ÄúYou might be feeling empty, numb, or ‚Äúblank,‚Äù but not exactly sad. Even if those around you don‚Äôt suspect anything is wrong, you might wonder if there‚Äôs something serious going on.‚Äù‚Äî-

THATS LITERALLY HOW I FEEL when i explain how all the adhd trauma from medications makes me feel like my personality is gone like, i don‚Äôt feel myself, i feel empty and numb all the time, like i get told i‚Äôm the same but i just don‚Äôt feel it like that‚Äôs how i feel

so what i believe could have started with what i‚Äôm feeling is when covid hit, starting online school when i‚Äôm not good with school in general and i‚Äôm a in person learner, having to stop skating and barely skating bc of covid, like yeah i still always had that empty feeling like that numbness feeling towards how i think and other things but like not being motivated and all this other stuff. And another thing that‚Äôs going to bother me if i do get diagnosed with some sort of depression is the fact that all my life when i‚Äôve tried to explain things to mom or to (sister) with how i feel, they always tell me i‚Äôm fine and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me, so i feel like that‚Äôs going to happen and it just hurts to think that my own sister and mom feel that way about me. But then when i would speak to (friend) and her mom bc they actually understand all this bc they‚Äôve been through it years they used to tell me i need to talk to a therapist or medications from my doctor. But also i‚Äôve explain all this to nana and i‚Äôm glad that she understands how i feel about this and i‚Äôm going to talk to my doctor, nana said that i need to write it all in my notes but the thing is i can‚Äôt unless i‚Äôm like talking to someone i‚Äôm comfortable with so i‚Äôm just going to read him the messages i‚Äôve sent bc it explains it and kinda explain more of what i can to him if i can then but if i think of more things that i‚Äôm forgetting then i‚Äôll write it all in my notes 

the thing is is why i was so emotional today about it, is bc i just found that article today about the non sadness depression and all that and this could be my issue and it‚Äôs just emotional for me bc i‚Äôve been so frustrated with what‚Äôs wrong with me and not knowing what‚Äôs wrong with me and i‚Äôve been thinking that it could be my medication from when i was younger it still could be but with how i explain my trauma from all the medications make me feel now the depression things just makes sense bc i feel empty, i feel numb and i‚Äôve always thought it was just from the medications

i always thought that no way i could be depressed bc i‚Äôm not suicidal, im not sad all the time, but i do feel empty i do feel not normal all the time like i know something‚Äôs wrong with me idk. I have no motivation to do anything needing to do, i have no motivation to care for myself. I‚Äôve been feeling like this for years now and i just don‚Äôt know why i want answers. 

i just have a constant fear that everytime i think about this stuff that bothers me maybe im like overthinking it of over reacting about it and maybe i am fine and that i don‚Äôt need help with this idfk but then again i also think im looking at all this as if im not as bad as (friend) and how she was and i forget that there are other issues that people struggle with and i struggle with my own issues and it is a reason to find help but idk i think it‚Äôs the anxiety. ugh idk how to explain it.

259,t3_ypu7ld,depression,I just don't know what to do,"I'm stuck at a shitty WFH job, living with my parents at 25. I've got barely any privacy, somebody is almost always home. I don't meet new people, except for new hires at work which are spread all over the country. But when their training period is over, the contact drops anyway, because it's a rather individual job. 

I have education, could've been a teacher. But I'm terrified of public appearances, so the idea of talking to a class full of 20+ people makes me shudder. 

My friends from high school spread out too. Some moved out, others moved on with their lives, some are starting families, while I sit at home, log in to work, then log out and sit on my couch until it's time to go to sleep again. 

I feel like my parents are getting tired of me not moving with my life. I'm the same person I was 10 years ago, except I go to work instead of going to school. And obviously I have less social life now. I feel like I'm letting them down. I try not to be a parasite and I pull my own weight, buy my own food and give my share to pay the bills. 

I've got nothing to base my suspicions about my parents getting tired of me on, but I just feel like this is the case. They know my friends are doing better. 

I'd be fucking ashamed at this point to meet somebody I used to know. Tell them I still live with my parents. 

It's barely possible for a single to move out in this economy, too. I feel like I'm doomed. Time flies and my life isn't going to wait for me. But what am I supposed to do? My friends have their own careers, families, relationships. I'm not going to go out myself and do what? Sit by the bar alone? I really don't know what to do. I'm disappointed in myself. Back in high school I remember thinking about how my life would look at 20, 22, 25. Now I know and I'm not happy about it. 

I used to take Prozac, but I stopped. Didn't think it really helped me all that much. Now I think that maybe it did and I should go back to it. 

It's embarrassing, honestly. Some of my few friends sometime write to me and ask what's up. I've got nothing to tell them except work stuff. I make things up to make myself look like a more interesting person. I'd say ""oh I was here and there and I'm learning this and that"" not to look like a complete waste of space. It's pathetic. Lying to my only friends not to seem like a depressed loser. Before they ask too many personal questions I send a stupid meme or song or whatever to steer the conversation away from me. 

At this rate I'm going to sit at home with my parents and do only work until I'm forty. Even when my friends, very rarely, find some time to spend together it's mostly drinking. I hate alcohol, I hate myself drunk. I can't even really get blackout drunk anymore, there's a switch in my head that tells me to stop. So even when I actually go out, once or twice a year, I'm the first to call a taxi and go home. Cause I physically can't drink over a certain limit. Maybe it's a blessing. 

But you know how it is, when you're not drunk enough for the rest of the company. Everyone is annoying then. And what if they ask me about my life? What am I gonna say? I'd rather dip from any social gathering before they start asking. Because I've got fuck all to say about myself. And I've got a couple pushy friends who love to give me advice, which makes me feel like even more of a loser. I don't blame them, they may be concerned. But it's not like all my troubles go away because my friend tells me to move out or change job. It's a start and I would love to do that, but I know it myself. I hate heartfelt talks about myself. I can't open up like that. 

I think moving out would be a good start. Preferably to another city to maybe meet new people. But with my current salary, I'd lose 80-90% of what I make just to pay the bills and get food. And bigger cities, cities with more occasions to improve my social life are expensive. 

There are days when I'm optimistic. I've got five long years before I hit 30, which is an arbitrary age I decided I should find happiness by. Many things can still happen. But then I remember that that's what I thought about hitting 25, too. And then I remember a thing, a situation or a conversation I had ""recently"" and I realise it was already x months ago. And before I blink I will be 26, 27, 28. 

I really don't have many *it is what it is*'s left to say. I can feel the weight of my problems crushing me. And I know it sounds stupid considering how entitled I am compared to some people with other problems.

260,t3_ypu6sp,depression,Is it worth following your dreams?," I am in my 30s and ever since I was a kid, I wanted to pursue my dreams as a stuntman and pursue martial arts. Ive always been self taught since I couldnt afford to go to a martial arts school since I was a kid, and been that way since. However, when I graduated high school, I was ready to pursue my dream, by teaching myself...however...so many circumstances happened...lets just say it was all my fault. I kept failing and failing and even injuring myself because I was neglecting the importance of proper training and such. This also affected my schooling and I ended up going into deep depression....for more than 5 years. Because I kept failing, and I see my friends that once started as amateurs already living their dreams in the movies and performing arts. And here I am, just alone...isolating myself. Because they all told me ""I told you so"". I really did horrible mistakes and most regrettably...I hurt my parents. I ruined and embarrassed them in front of their friends. After living my life as a hikkomori (recluse), I was able to get myself to graduate and land an ok paying salary....but my love for martial arts in the entertainment business is still there.

I feel like I don't deserve to pursue my dreams, and atone for the mistakes I made by probably working for a career to help people...I probably will be ok...probably. At least im living and still alive. Grateful that I have two feet and keep on living while so many people younger than me have died and have physical problems. I try to live by that everyday.

Everyday, I try to make up the mistakes, even try to prove to God that I'm sorry. Especially sorry to my parents and the people I've hurt and didnt listen to.

Do you think because of my history, is it worth to try at least once? Yet if I try to pursue it....I have this deep regret. Deep anxiety. I have not even tried once because I started to develop social anxiety.

I am 19, girl, freshman at college pursuing engineering in computer science

My parents have been married for 22 years. It's not a successful happy marriage. It never was. It's an arranged marriage. No romance, no love, no communication between them. 

So my mom and dad live 3 hrs way because of work requirements. My dad used to come home every weekend. He maybe has short temper or bipolar disorder. Mom doesn't fight but she has her own childhood trauma and genetically inherited depression episodes (yes i might have it too), mood swings and ignorance.

(You see, they are so much liked by their friends and colleagues, i could never figure out why they didn't get along. Personality differences and age gap (11 yrs) perhaps.)

When I was in 6th grade I clearly told my mom it's not a problem if dad doesn't come home for 2-3 months. I won't be sad. I want our house to be peaceful. I dont want you both fighting. She always comes to me, tells me everything about their fights, cries - but when i give her a solution she doesn't execute it. What's more frustrating is that she has been venting all about her childhood trauma and fights with dad and marriage problems infront of me but always ends up saying - I always kept u away from all these, never let u know about my problems etc etc. I am tired of this. As I grew up I understood she won't change. She asks him to come home herself. Then he has his mood swings at home, he behaves violently and then the whole weekend the whole family is stressed and tensed. And he goes away. She vents. She invites him again.

THE REAL SHIT:-

She: ""I don't want him to come, so u see how u will stop him from coming.""
Me: ""Excuse me, why should I do that?""

She: ""It's ok, children solve their parents' problems everytime. I am not wrong at doing this.""
Me:""I have said this since 6th grade that I don't mind if u ask him to not come this month. Why are u dragging me into this? How can I choose a side?""
She: "" Don't start this drama okay, now that I am telling you my problem you are escaping it. Wow. You have to solve this issue.""
Me: "" Mom are u listening to urself? I have been listening to your trauma and fights since I was 10. I can't do it anymore. And why do u even tell ur kids about the problems in ur relationship. Which parent does that? I have clearly said a long time ago that I am fine if u get divorce. I just want you to be happy. Then why are you dragging this for years and years and now u are bringing me in between too?""
She: ""Don't be so dramatic okay.""
.... a few days before this conversation, she also told me that she's having doubt that dad's cheating on her. I know that dad's cheating on her. But why is she telling me? Even if I solve the issue here, she'll go back to him and I'll be the bad person as always...

(Between age kindergarten till 15 ) And a lot of shit happened. 
I feel like I am infamous in a way and my existence is fated to be just a point of mockery and inferiority in the eyes of most. 

Contemplated suicide so many times that I can not count and I have the means but my family had a case of suicide and I would not want them to blame themselves. It's just that I am very sensible and introverted now, with low social battery and I can not portray that always happy and bubbly persona to the world, because I am barely living inside, I just try to live day by day, thinking about the future and making plans knowing that I might feel the pain of the existence so hard one day, that I will fall from trying to hold on and move on. 

Idk why some are such assholes, since little I tried so hard to be a part of anything, to be a good friend, to belong and to be cared. I have some friends and a boyfriend of a year and a half, family, a job. But I feel that because I am not portraying that bubbly and talkative personality, people don't like me. I just try to heal and live among others, even as a subhuman in most eyes. Sometimes I feel like the wounds heal a bit just to be spread open shortly after. I have been trying so hard to belong anywhere. 
People do not know and do not realize how hard it is to live trough constant trauma and ridicule. It's like you are one of those zoo animals that were kept hundreds of years ago, captured just to be looked at, and mocked, till you eventually die. 

People are so hypocrite, they talk about minor abuse and mock me because I feel pray to I'll intended humans. Mitigate against consent and rape but at the same time, talk about how I was drunk and how dumb I was that I didn't notice the cameras. I am the criminal because I fell pray to predators and bullies. I am the criminal because I trusted my fellow human and they deceived my trust and broken my trust in people. 
I feel that we humans think we are so advanced... But we are just in theory always understanding,  inclusive and kind for real. 
Such weird creatures we are sometimes. We can be really beautiful too, when we want. 

I have been showing a happy persona since a adolescent. Wasn't property socialsed and I have struggled with making friends, been always anxious. Tried to fit in ended bad every time as the time passed. Cried absolutely every night for years and the next morning smiled at anyone that saluted me or talked with me. 

Idk, calm and happy life isn't for everyone.

I've also been getting more frequent migraines as well...I can remember 7 in the past few months whereas I previously would probably only get about 1-2 per year. 

In my 20s (currently 35m), I ate pretty well, exercised a ton, and felt/looked great. Never struggled with anxiety/depression or had migraines. Energy was no problem. 

Since then life has happened. Fully engrained in my career. Got married. Had a baby. Had a pandemic. I remember I used to steer clear of fast food at all costs, but now it's the norm. Not uncommon for me to eat fast food once or twice a day, just out of pure convenience. Caffeine consumption is way up to counteract the overall lack of energy I feel every day. I get super annoyed if I have to get up from the couch for anything. It's frustrating because I'm fucking lazy and I see it happening, but the energy is just not there. Oh and weight gain? Yup...never been heavier (170lb was 'normal' for me...currently at probably 230...not entirely sure because I'm too lazy to get up and weigh myself).

Everytime I‚Äôve tried to work and it‚Äôs come out about my condition no one wants to support me in the workplace, and I‚Äôm fired. I did get a degree, but it was only a 2.2 because I was just so cripplingly depressed, and couldn‚Äôt give it my best due to this. Also, I nearly got kicked out of university because I was aggressive. My whole life, I‚Äôve struggled to cope.  


A few years ago, I met a man who seemed really really nice, and I honestly thought that he was genuine and he promised me a house, even potentially having a family of our own one day was mentioned and I really thought he was so lovely, he bought me nice things, took me lovely places and we even went holiday together. I think this holiday was a big mistake though because of my severe anxiety, and his mum also came with us, and saw how bad my anxiety was, and nothing was ever the same after that. She stopped cooking or doing anything for me, or even bothering with me whatsoever. I think my autism ruined the entire relationship, and I am just so angry that I had to be born with this condition, it is just horrendous. It‚Äôs ruined my life.   


I am prescribed antidepressants, but these are no use because they do not fix the reason I am depressed, my autism and appauling social skills are the reason I‚Äôm so depressed, I have no friends either, and if I do, these people do not care about me, they never ask me to meet up. One just uses me as a sounding board to go on and on about her health constantly. I‚Äôve started having to just ignore her. Another ‚Äòfriend‚Äô spoke to me absolutely horribly, and said I really make people feel frustrated, and think I am thick and dumb, because I couldn‚Äôt properly grasp what he was trying to ask me. This is how I get treated.   


I‚Äôve got a nice flat, but I really really hate it round there because I am just so lonely. I stay with immediate family a lot due to this, but even they get sick of me staying round there house and tell me I should go home. I‚Äôve got no extended family either, so when I‚Äôm not staying with them, I‚Äôm just all alone. I really really long for a family of my own.

I really hate my life but just don‚Äôt know how to change it. I‚Äôm trying self employment, but as I‚Äôm not working with other people, I am so lonely and it just sucks. I know I‚Äôm unlikely to ever have a partner and children because of the way I am.

Isolation turned me into a terrible person, trapping me in my isolation. I say terrible things to people and expect them to get over it. But it's not alright. It's horrible. I'm terribly ashamed of myself. It has made my live worse and hurts the people who care about me.

These are the types of things I don't often see on this subreddit. People admitting that their depression is their own fault. But for me, it definately is. I've created this mess for myself. I've hurt the people I love with my anger. I've destroyed my friendships with cruel words. I shut out everyone and everything I love and live a deliberately solitary life.

This is a problem that defies medical diagnosis. It's not bipolar. It's not borderline personality disorder. It's just reacting the wrong way to my emotional pain. Deep down, I think I would be a much better person if I had companionship, any companionship. But I refuse to accept it on anyone else's terms but my own. Without it, I'm a rotten soul who can't treat people kindly to save my own life. I created this wall for myself, and at this point, it's inescapable.

If it were torn down, given enough time, I'd build it back again. That's exactly what *The Wall* is all about. So if anyone asks me what's wrong with me, the only correct answer is, *The Wall*.",1.0,3.0,0.0,3.0

285,t3_yprdhg,depression,I've lost all of my friends and relationship in the past 48 hours.,"I won't try to cover up the fault or why this is happening. I did this to myself.

I did something absolutely terrible that breached the trust of a few key select ex-friends of mine which subsequently caused turmoil with quite literally every other friend that I had. I've lost all of my best friends that have treated me like family. I've lost all of the female friends as well. I've repaid their generosity that they've shown me for the past 5 years with a sickening form of betrayal.

I've lost the girl that I've been talking to for the past 4 months. I just really feel like our personals matched so well and everytime we would talk or hangout or quite literally do anything, it just meshed and felt right. I did something terrible though that betrayed her trust and she has now blocked me on our usual messaging app. It really just kills me inside knowing that I did this to myself and there's nothing I can do to recover what was lost. I don't see what the point of coming back is if all that's left at the end is me, myself, and I.

The rational side of me understands a few things:

* It'll get better if you continue on, there's always a light at the end of the tunnel
* 4 Months is a relatively short time to be speaking with someone - you'll bounce back
* People will always lose friends as life goes on, it's normal - I would strongly argue that this is so entirely different because of how intertwined one person can be to a plethora of others where I live

I just need to vent and it really sucks because the one support group I had is the same set of individuals that I've either directly or subsequently betrayed. I know they all say they want to see me get better, but I know that's just a secondary thought. ""I hope he gets the help he needs but I still don't want to see him again."", that sort of thing.

Not sure what my purpose in writing all of this is. I don't think I'm clinically depressed either, but I know for a fact that this is the saddest I've ever been. I have lost everything that I knowingly cared about in less than 48 hours and I don't know how to cope. I still have my parents and a cousin that although knows what happened, understands why I might've opted to do what it is that I did. He is still there for me, although it just feels odd because he's also closely tied with my now ex-friends. I feel like I just can't go outside anymore out of fear that someone that I know or knows someone that I know will see me and know what was done. 

I don't know how I can feel better and if I even want to. I'm in a position where I quite literally need to pack up and move to another province to avoid any ties with anyone here. I just fear that if I do that then I'll be entirely alone in a foreign place. I've been so comfortable with the circle that's been with me for so many years that I've forgotten how to make new connections. Any connections to be made in this city are no longer safe as someone will always know a friend of a friend and so forth.

I would just like to hear what anyone here has to say. It really would help.

Edit: I would just like to say that I haven't done any heinous criminal act that would condemn me to a prison cell. I just royally fucked up and betrayed what trust my friends and partner had bestowed on me. I did not sleep with any of my friends or girlfriends of friends either.",1.0,9.0,0.0,9.0

Me (M21) and my girlfriend (20) started dating 2.5 years ago. We started dating in lockdown so it was mainly via text / calling. I went to university a couple of weeks after we met but decided I wanted to stay together.

We spent the next 6 months texting / calling mostly until I cam home for Summer. I‚Äôve always been anxious about losing her when she went to university we should went on to do after that summer. But we remained together and we would visit each other every 2 weeks. My time at university was difficult, my housemate and friend died of suicide and I had to undergo surgery on my stomach the same year. We had a very happy relationship despite my own struggles. 

Since September I started to have thoughts about something very minor I did very early on into the relationship (nothing major at all) these thoughts continued to mount despite being such a long time ago. I eventually told my girlfriend the truth which did upset her but I was more upset that I did something to hurt her. I fell into a spiral of firstly guilt then I couldn‚Äôt forgive myself. After a few days she completely forgave me and I did too. However, from that moment I began to lose interest in my girlfriend. But I was not happy with this at all and can‚Äôt seem to work out why. Every time I message or call her I think ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt love her‚Äô or ‚Äòthis is broken‚Äô. I keep having these thoughts even when she‚Äôs not around.

I am desperate for my feelings toward her to change and have that massive desire again to call her/ spend time with her.

I'm gonna try to go in order so you can understand everything the best possible. My life started a downfall when my parents splitted up (money problems). My father is an irresponsible person and spent a lot of money without us knowing, after a long time doing it he told my mother when he saw he couldn't keep it a secret anymore and she told him to just tell all the truth (which he clearly didn't do) ,so my mom after a long time going back and forth w him to tell her everything he did so they could fix it together, just told him to fuck off, and he did. This was my first hit, aproximately a year ago he left, and left me being the man of the house with a 14yo brother and my mom, keep in count i was just an 18 yo who had almost 0 responsabilities. From there I just do everything but work, bc my mom does, I take care of every appointment of her or my brother, take them to every place they need, shop whatever is needed at home, etc etc, basically everything a man does for his family except working bc i can't find a job and even if I found it it wouldn't make it any better. I was like that for a while till i met this girl a few months after, on february 2022. I just fell in love w her from the beginning, she was 16 then, now she's 17 and im still 19, everything was so fine when she was with me, we saw eachother almost everyday until problems started gathering together, she wanted to have a little bit of freedom in some things (not partying or some sort of whorely things, just freedom to drink, smoke sometime, have a tattoo, things like that) (who doesn't, she was 16, i just was too occupied becoming a man that I didn't notice i was just like her a year ago) I couldn't let her do anything and kept pressuring her to stick to my rules or go away. And finally on july in one of our arguments we just agreed to end everything and get out of eachothers lifes. (Fuck, why did I do that?) If I was broke before, after we splitted up and the ""i feel so good"" days after the breakup passed. I was just DEMOLISHED. I lost the only person who always was there for me, always supported me in anything I wanted to do, never left me when I needed her, etc. So after a couple months I tried to contact her, and I ended up seeing her to talk a little bit but it didn't end up well, she was with another guy at the moment. I don't blame her, I was trying to replace her too, but finally they didn't work out (hell they won't, that girl won't ever have someone who loves her and cares about her as much as me, and I won't have a girl who does that for me either, its just her, its hard to explain, we've been through so much together and she's so special that no words can explain it). She got angry at me shortly after because she was having some issues in her life, which I noticed so I stopped trying to contact her for another while, till like 2 weeks ago. I talked to her and she wasn't angry anymore, we talked to stay as friends bc we love eachother and we both don't want to lose eachother, so we agreed to hang out on friday to smoke some weed and chill. We did, but that same afternoon after we smoked we went into my car and started listening to music, which ended with us huging, kissing and when we was just perfect, the time for her female friend to arrive was up, so we stayed with her for like 2h while she was literally acting as we got back and when her friend left we had just 30 min left for her to go home, which we used not as wisely as we could, 25 min cuddling, 5 min sex, great, she goes home, everything feels like before, im surprised, happy, but i feel something is not right, and it isn't. After that she talks to me on the phone as nothing happened, sometimes lovely, sometimes as we are only friends, it makes me go crazy, yesterday i just saw her and in the whole afternoon we was just chill like friends and for a while I got her to cuddle (we talked a little bit and the thing is she doesn't want to be in a relationship because she doesn't want anyone to just tell her everything she has to do, I wonder who provoked this fear in her, fuck me) and we kissed a couple times, nothing crazy, then we went with another friend of her till she had to go home, so no bye bye kiss, came home broke because of how strange everything is and idk. I know for a fact a part of her wants to get back together, and all parts of me want, but she has some internal battle that sometimes tells her to get back, and sometimes doesn't. I talked with a good friend of class that she has, and she told me she loves me but rn she's not in the vibe to go back, she told me to just keep being normal with her and not being too emotional by text, and when we meet to just let everything happen and from here to 1-2 months talk to her seriously about getting back together. But hell, it looks like it could work, but 1-2 months? yesterday driving back home after seeing her was just a living hell, I couldn't have it anymore, it seriously was the worst 15-20 min that i've had in a veery long time. This was the girls part, now comes the ""what to do with my life part"": I've never been clear about what I want (except for that girl, she's the exception to the rule) so when i finished secondary studies, i started working online helping people with tech problems, which worked fine for a while but now i just don't get clients so its over, and anyway it's not a very safe future to build a family which is my number 1 priority, my father couldn't handle a family well so I'll make sure I do and so will my son/s. So a few weeks ago I saw an ad about an academy that prepares you to tryout for the military, and bc my grandparents were both soldiers I thought, fuck, if i still can't find a thing to study for the future, fuck it, im going to the military (same error as always). Made my mom spend almost 3k‚Ç¨ on this course and i just started but im realizing i can't do it, im just not interested enough, but im afraid to tell my mother because she works hard as fuck for me to just throw out 3k of her money bc i didn't decide well (the thing is she isn't too convinced about me going to the military so i think it wouldn't hurt that that much, but still, her biggest problem rn is the money and idk how mad she will be if i tell her i really don't like this and she threw out that money) also if i don't do this i still have a big problem, wtf do i do. I'm almost 20 and I need to do something to start getting money and get tf out of my mothers house so i can build a life for myself and in a few years have a family. So this is pretty much it, if i forgot smth i will update the post or reply in the comments to anyone who asks. Thank you if u read everyone, i really apprecciate u, and please comment smth, I need help, I don't think I can keep up with this for too much longer, I feel just empty, broken, the only time I can really be calm and don't worry bout nothing is when I'm with this girl that I talked about and we're just cuddling in the car, and I don't get that frequently, who knows when I'll stop getting it, hope I never do.

Im a 18yr black male , that's now in college. recently my mom kicked me out and now im living with my aunt and have also took my car. and to even add cherry on top , my father is still incarcerated. I always question myself, where did everything go wrong? why the fuck does this shit has to happen? why cant life just be ""normal""? I just don't get it. I want to be able to feel again. I want to be able to just be happy for once. Back in 2016 , that year was golden. there was peace in my life , and even if there was a problem , i brushed it on my shoulder and go out and play splatoon on my wii u or some shit. but now , everything keeps catching up to me and causing me issues. And not to mention the world is going to shit as well. now i'm not just glossing over the fact the world has always been to shit , but I feel like the world is getting worst and worst. I just wish as we all humans , come together and step outside of reality and think , what should we do as a whole to become better. what can we do? like life don't have to be about chaos like it really doesn't. I just want peace for gods sake. all these fucking wars and fucking murders , its fucking ridiculous. we dont see any bears doing this shit, or even fucking penguins having wars or even massacring each other over complete bullshit. listen , to whom all reading this , why not make a change. I want to make a change. I want to become a better person. I want to live life with tranquility. But its how you do it. How you want to understand that the rose may grow from the concrete. In human life, we come in different colors and cultures. But it doesn't mean to hate each other. we are made out of the same material. sperm and egg. so why hate and make barriers for each other?

Sonic Frontiers released right at midnight and my partner and I were looking forward to that, but I have horrible internet so what took him a few minutes took me 6 hours to download 20 gb. I already felt sad he could play without me, he just kept talking and talking, I started to sort of zone him out and become a little bit numb, I hate that I can't even remember most of what he said, I was just feeling awful but he never catches onto this. He doesn't question my short responses or lack of, he just keeps talking. I went to lay down because the download was gonna take forever and I wasn't feeling well/tired, it was so hard to muster the energy to respond to everything he was saying while I was laying down. It felt so forced, I feel so embarrassed and just sad. He kept begging me to get up but he doesn't understand. He doesn't understand how hard it is to get up, I don't even want to, I just feel so miserable and he isn't supportive of that at all. I tell him what I need to hear when I feel this way but he doesn't say anything. Fast forward 3 hours to where I can finally wake up, I stream Sonic to him, and I suck. I'm not used to Sonic games not holding your hand, it felt weird and new, and he just teased me for it. Usually I don't mind the teasing but it's just teasing paired with lack of support and my embarrassment. I just feel so put off from streaming games to him and want to go die in a fucking hole. I hate everything and feel so miserable. This may sound simple to some, but this was a lot for me.  


Edit: I just wanted to add that I've been feeling more suicidal than ever, this game was what I was looking forward to to bring me happiness. I don't mention to him that I'm suicidal because he is as well, I don't want to put that on him or make it about ""me.""",1.0,3.0,0.0,3.0
301,t3_yppegl,depression,I want help but I'm tired of reaching out,"I've been managing my issues on my own since I've also carried on believing that these issues are mine and mine alone and so they are my responsibilities to deal with. 

But I used to ask for help actually altho I didn't really ask for help often but I do reach out to certain people in my life in hopes that they could help me help myself. Then I stopped. The truth is it has become so draining for me and I become more and more afraid each time I open up myself to someone, most specially when they're someone who's close to me.

It's just that I'm tired of explaining myself over and over again. Tired of pouring my heart out and expressing how much I'm hurting. I'm tired of hearing unsolicited advice when I just need these people to be there for me, you know? Like offer me a shoulder to lean on, a hug, or something and just listen. I'm tired of tolerating people, of being disappointed by people who I thought would be able to understand or comfort me but then they end up hurting me even more instead. I'm tired of explaining, trying to tell them I just want them to be there. 

Not only do I feel tired of it but I do feel shame as well. I feel bad for it, for asking this and that, for asking comfort, for asking help. I feel like I'm putting them in a situation they don't want to be in and so I feel ashamed for being this way, for not being able to fix myself up.

What's fucked up too is when I started pulling that part of myself away from them and just being all giddy and funny, putting up masks that ""yeah, I got it all together now"", they're relieved. Like I get it that it's somewhat of a relief like ""oh thank goodness you're okay now"" but it rubs me in the wrong way. Idk how to express it properly but it's as if they're relieved that they don't have to deal with it anymore. Does that make sense? And they only seem to be there for me through my ""ups"" but not my downs.

Idk. It just really feels like I have no one else I could count on when it comes to times like this and I can't do it anymore. I'm tired and I just wanna wither away.

308,t3_ypoazr,depression,"The problem with ""Nothing matters so do whatever you want""","I've been on the search for purpose and the point of living for years at this point possibly a decade. I look at forums like this and even to a therapist/ counselor of my own for answers. 

Some repeated comments that became annoying and unhelpful like
1. You aren't the only one 
2. Nothing really matters in the end so do things that matter to you
3. Nobody knows what their doing so do whatever 
4. You can change direction at anytime stop being hard on yourself
5. Find the thing you're good at and do that
6. Have some meds (that's just me and I'm a bit bitter about that)


Like I said it's been almost 10 years where I've used this line of thinking whether I knew what it was or not. At the time I really wanted these things to be true or helpful and really gave it my best shot to find other people with the same diagnosis or experience as me to the best of my ability (Reddit). Did a lot of thinking to the things that matter to me but the more I think about it there was none, I don't really care about my family even though they are ok people I think, don't really care about money or going places. I barely left my room since COVID, I have no reason to go anywhere because I just don't care. I tried to think about the things I'm good at, and there is nothing. I have beginners luck but after that it takes so much effort and since I can do what I want and I don't care anyway I'll stop. I actually think I've become dumber being like this, I used to be really smart, it was the one thing i was good at. 

Then came the therapist that I had a really hard time explaining my feelings to because the most I could come up with is that I feel bored and exhausted all the time and doing anything takes so much energy that I need 3 days in bed to recover. On top of the fact that it wasn't as often and they gave me meds that didn't work and by the time I go back for refills to avoid having to explain things that I can't find the words for, I take the shitty sugar pills to go home and cry my eyes out. They were so shit I couldn't even OD on them I just felt really high. They didn't take me seriously I don't think on top of the system being so full having emails ignored an so on. So when people advise going to therapy you can eat my ass. 

Which brought me back to ""nothing matters anyway, do what you want"". Awesome except when I think of what I want that doesn't involve the obvious 'die bitch die!' it sounds so tedious and tiring that I need to lay down from laying down doing all that thinking. I tried giving myself something to do and I'm one month away from it being done and it i really despise that I did that because I become really uncomfortable with going anywhere even if it's with people I know, doing a thing I was once good at and enjoyed and it's once a week. It's too much.

My mental fortitude has deminished considerably and I can't bring myself to care except that I don't want to feel like this that's all I know. This sucks a lot. ""Whatever I want"" means nothing and has kept me damn near bed ridden. I wish people would find something else pretentious to say. Anything else, keep it as pretentious as you want I don't care, none of it is helpful anyways and makes you feel better for you and that's fine.  


To conclude, I guess trying to do what I want has lead me to a place where I'm fighting to just be comfortable in the only place that feels comfortable; my room, my bed, my home and nowhere else. Kind of paradoxical since I'm here with this screaming about how uncomfortable everything including being like this is making me just because nothing matters.",0.95,14.0,0.0,14.0

Before reading this, I first want to apologise for the length of this post. Second, I want to thank each of you that read this for taking the time out of your day to do so. It means a lot to me. I am and have not written this post to seek or gain attention. I am not the attention seeking type. I have written this to put into words what goes through my head each and every day.

Every day I wake up, and the first though through my head is that I should take my own life. I wonder why should I even bother? Why bother getting out of bed? Why bother doing anything? There‚Äôs no point to doing anything at all so why don‚Äôt I just have done with it and end it all? Save anyone having to think about me or even worry about me?

What or who stops me? The thought of my niece finding out her uncle is no longer around to see her anymore. The thought of the few friends who actually give a fuck and ask how I‚Äôm doing each day.

I was diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety in 2008 following the loss of a very close friend.

\- June 2019, I lost my father to pneumonia.

\- September 2020, I find out my mother has Brain Cancer

\- November 2020, I find out my mother also has Lung Cancer in her left lung.

\- May 2021, my mother tells my sister and I that she hasn‚Äôt got much longer left to live.

\- June 2021, I lose my temper and scare my niece while showering her. My niece threw a tantrum when it came to trying to wash her hair, as she didn‚Äôt like the water, didn‚Äôt want her hair washing, all the while trying to get out of the shower, I lost my temper, shouted at her, called her vulgar names which I deeply regret, and have to live knowing how much I scared her. A neighbour came to check that she was ok, found my niece had stepped out of the shower and was stood shivering. Neighbour takes my niece, calls me a liar when trying to explain the situation.

\- Same day in June 2021, SIX hours later, my sister calls the police and has me removed citing that she is fearful of me doing something to her (not my niece).

\- 2 days later I return back home after a conversation with my sister wherein she says that she has no money to pay for the bills due to my not being there. My sister cites that she is doing so reluctantly and as long as I look for my own place to live, that I won‚Äôt be able to look after my niece or take her with me to the shops without supervision as Social Services are involved after what has happened.

\- June 2022, 24 hours after remembering the day our father died, my sister and her partner ask me when I am moving out as my niece‚Äôs school allegedly want to know due to safeguarding issues. Also claiming that my niece doesn‚Äôt want me around, doesn‚Äôt like me being in the house.

\- June 2022, I leave the house and the area completely

During the 12+ months since I lost my temper with my niece, she and I had a great relationship. She would come home from school, get changed then come into the room where I was setup with my PC to get her toys or a book. She would look at what games I was playing or films I was watching and ask questions about them. She would allow me to hug her, tickle her and give her good night kisses. This same little girl who was allegedly not wanting me around or wanting me in the house anymore. I confronted my sister on the claims of Social Services being involved as during the 12+ months they had never and have to this day still not contacted me about what happened in June 2021. Each time I challenged my sister on this, she would always make excuses saying that they are busy, have other cases to deal with.

I believe that everything my sister has said and done over this time to be complete lies. I have spoken with my own GP and therapist, and they too have questioned as to why Social Services never spoke to me if they were involved in any such case, as they would want to make sure that during the time I remained at my former home, that everything was ok between me and my niece. But, as I have said, not once did or have social services spoken to me or written to me.

This is the timeline of what I have dealt with, and what plays on my mind every day, among other things. These are the most recent events which currently make me feel useless, unwanted and unloved. I have to reach out to my sister to see how my niece is doing. The times my sister has messaged me to see how I am doing it has always been ‚Äúhi, sorry to bother you, I hope you‚Äôre ok, but when are you sending the money you owe‚Äù. I did owe some money, but that is a lengthy tale in and of itself. Not once has my sister contacted me to strike up an actual conversation, it is me that is doing the reaching out and I am only reaching out purely and simply for the sake of my niece. She means the world to me, and I miss her every single day. She is as I‚Äôve said the main reason that I keep fighting every day.

But it is so damned hard. I know I need to try and push on and move forward and to think about myself for once. I know I need to stop thinking about the loss of my parents, I know that if there is such a place as heaven that they are looking down on me wishing for me to move on and live my life, to be happy. I know that they are upset at the fact that I keep dwelling on what‚Äôs already happened.

I‚Äôm not like other people who can do that though. I wear my heart on my sleeve. I would sooner listen to other people‚Äôs problems than deal with my own. I try not to talk about any of what I have already said to those who do care about me because I don‚Äôt want to upset them or piss them off.

I know reaching out goes both ways, but in all this time not one family member has reached out to me to ask how I am, to make sure I am ok.

As I‚Äôve previously said, I wake up every day fighting to not take my own life. I know I need help, and I will get that help when I feel I am ready for it, but right now I am not ready to take that path.

They do care for and about me, but, from what I've felt the past 3/4 years, us that they don't desire my company. I'm the first person in my family to go for a college degree (most didn't even graduate highschool). Not only that, I'm going for two separate degrees in both art and science and got accepted to my dream university after graduating highschool... Early!... no one cares...
I've been given the opportunity to travel the world for work and school. I've traveled more in my 26 years so far than most of my family combined.
And no one cares...
All of this while dealing with literal memory loss, brain damage, ADHD, social anxiety disorder, general anxiety disorder, and depression.
There response... neet...
Both sides of my family have a history of drug and alcohol addictions. And it's celebrated when someone overcomes their addiction(s). But, I'm the only one who never became addicted to anything! The only truly sober person in my family. And no one celebrates my will to stay away from that crap.
I'm in college still, going for my two bachelors, a masters and a Doctorate (again, first person in my imediate family to even graduate highschool) and when the family gets together, no one has any curiosity to my life or progress. No. They turn to my little sister who dropped out of college and decided to work a 9-5 (I love and respect my little sis, but I'm jealous).

And it's not just my family. I'm a 26 year old male with social anxiety disorder, I live alone 200 miles from family, in a different state I moved to for school. I've lived here for more than two years, and have not made any friends with anyone. No matter who I'm around or where I am, kindness to others is always my goal. I love to bring a smile to everyone's face. But no smile for anyone comes from my company.

I have, and am doing so much. I am proud of what I've done and am doing. But... No one cares... I feel like I could find a way to end world hunger or stop climate change and no one would give a shit. Hell, they'd notice it happened, but when asked who did it, the response would be ""oh, just some guy."" Hell, I could somehow get elected president and noone would recognize me.

My family loves me and cares about me. But has no desire for me. My goal is kindness, and noone wants to be around me.

337,t3_ypiuhz,depression,My suicide is inevitable.,"I'm in my mid 20s. All I have is a part time job at a walmart, I don't have the energy or qualifications for more. I've tried full time work, apprenticeships and even just volunteering and they always end the same; I'm fired or they advise me not subtly to leave and not return after a few weeks or months.

I can't afford a place to live. I get ¬£300 a month, not nearly enough for even the least expensive of homes. I live with my parents and despite them saying otherwise, I know they're ashamed of me. They say right now they aren't, but all I do is sit alone in my bedroom for 18 hours a day. The only time I leave is to get food, go to my job two times a week or on rare occasions hang out with ""friends"" which only tolerate my presence out of pity. This isn't just a delusion; often I'm excluded because they know how sad I am and just talk in front and over me to make plans without even looking at me. I wish I could get upset, but I just understand. I don't want to hang out with me. Why would they?

It feels like I was born incomplete. My personality is non existent, I'm just a blank, empty shell. I have no ambition, no passion, nothing but shame and misery. I don't have a purpose or a place in the world, I'm just here. Nothing I'm good at, nor have the energy to get good at something. I don't have the creativity for art or writing. I never had the perseverance for a career. I feel like I have zero purpose or use in the world. I'm just a worm that crawls along its belly its entire life feeding on waste and dung left by others. I have nothing to give anyone.

My entire life plan right now is to wait. Wait until my family realises its for the best that I end myself so they can focus their attention on my older brother. He has a wonderful job, a serious girlfriend, a great house, and a university course. I have a part time job, nobody romantically (not that I deserve it) and a metaphorical basement. There's no comparison.

The day when my parents, brother and friends realise ""Actually maybe it is best that he dies"" will be very, very painful. But necessary. Like taking a sick dog to the vet to be put to sleep. I know where to do it and how to do it to make it easier for them. I'll go to Australia, get a rental car, get some inert gas tanks and oxygen and hook up a rig so I will suffocate myself. Drive into the desert for 8 hours minimum until I'm far from any road, city or town. Then call the police and give my exact location, tell them what I'm doing and why. Then use the rig and just go to sleep. My body will be intact for the family and easily retrievable. They won't have to deal with my head blown apart by a firearm, and hopefully my body would already be embalmed and presentable by the time my family sees me. I'm not afraid of this. I'm just nervous. Like waiting for the dentist. It's necessary, but unpleasant.

After all that is done, they can focus on my brother who actually has a future. My friends can stop pitying me. I know they'll be heartbroken for a while, even if they realise it was necessary. But I want them to get over it, to see it was all for the best and I should have done it sooner. They can just remember that one sad man who was here once but then wasn't.

I don't want pity, I don't want people to feel bad for me, I just want them to understand my death is necessary and everyone is better off for it. Including me. I've planned every step of my death down to where I'm getting each part for the inert gas suicide rig and just re reading my suicide note to make tiny tweaks to express my apologies, why I did it and what they should do next. Do what they want with my body, salvage any organs they can, maybe have a look at my brain to see what is wrong with it. Honor my name if they want, but don't feel obligated. Just forget about me and focus on what's really important.

I won't kill myself today. Or tomorrow, it probably won't even happen for a few years yet. But it's going to happen, it must happen and when it does all I can hope for is they recover quickly and healthily.",1.0,15.0,0.0,15.0

I feel like I wasn‚Äôt meant to be here which is why I am not able to attain a normal life like everyone else and have to suffer instead.

Background: My mom is my dad's 3rd partner. He had a first wife and had a mistress on the side long ago. He had 2 daughters with his first wife and 2 sons with his mistress. I am the 5th child and my sister are his children with his 3rd partner. Thus, my mom and dad were not married.

Growing up, I had to use my mom's surname as the law in my country did not allow for bastards to carry the dad's surname. It was only when I was about to finish high school that my parent's were able to change my surname to follow my dad officially as the law was amended then.

As our country is predominantly Catholic and I attended Catholic school all throughout my pre-university days, I always felt ashamed whenever I have to fill up a form with my surname and such as it was like a label telling everybody that I was a bastard.

Fast forwarding to now, I am 30 years old. I would say that my life has been hard and I find happiness to be something that is out-of-my reach. Things that come along naturally to other people's lives seem impossible for me to reach.

First of all, I went to work overseas on 2014 and I ended up falling in love with a Muslim in 2016. I did not want to convert even though his family kept forcing me to as I felt that it is an even graver sin to convert for the sake of his family's image. It came to a point where his family became aggressive with me and even said that our relationship is a sin and we are dragging his innocent family down to hell with us. They even threatened my job and my life so we had to resort to make it a legal matter by sending them a Cease and Desist letter. It was such a tumultuous time for me and though I have cut all contact with them, it still drags me down from time-to-time.

As my SO's family put so much pressure on him and kept verbally abusing him at home, he also suffered. It was then one of the factors as why it lead him to cheat on me in the 4th year of our relationship. It wasn't anything physical. Basically, he sought comfort from this girl (who knew he was attached) and ended up catching feelings for her. He then left me for her and it crushed me as not only was I hurt but it was also unexpected as I never thought he was capable of it. It ruined all my trust on him and how I saw him as a person. Long story short, he only ended chatting with her for a few more days after leaving me and then they met up in person for the first time. But on that same night, he texted me and asked me if I could forgive him. He then cut all ties with her and went back to me.

Anyways, fast forward to 2022, we ended up getting married. But due to the difference in religion, we only ended up having a civil solemnization. It was only done through zoom and we only asked 1 of his friend and my best friend as witnesses as required by the law. My family and friends are actually supportive but I just felt ashamed I guess that I didn't even tell anyone that we were getting married. I only told my mom like a week before and told her that it will just be signing a document via zoom so she does not need to attend. Thus I did not get the romantic wedding as the other people in my family or friends. My SO did not even propose to me and I even had to buy my own wedding ring as my SO was broke.

Even securing housing is an issue. As I am a foreigner, my husband is still considered as a ""single local"" and we are not able to get priority for public housing and will have to wait until my husband turns 35 to be able to join the ballot. Buying a 'resale' flat is out of reach as well as it is now too expensive. So we are only renting a room which is fine if not for the increase in rental in this country. I have a feeling that I would eventually be priced out of this country and have no choice but to go home to my home country eventually.

Due to the housing issue and our unstable relationship, it is really impossible right now for us to have a child. I feel that it would be unfair for the child and I feel like I would be infecting it with my miserable life. Accepting this reality is a huge blow for me as I have always dreamed of having kids since I turned 18.

I've already given up on any hopes, dreams, and ambitions now but not being able to have kids just makes me lose all meaning for my life. Perhaps it is because I have been ""indoctrinated"" since young that a normal life must follow the same path as other people i.e. get married-get a house &amp; car-have a kid. My career is also getting nowhere. I also do not have meaningful relationships. I am not just living day-by-day like an empty shell and waiting desperately to just die.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

The only thing different from me is I'm always on panic mode. Sometimes I think of committing and am even joking about it but that's just normal for a teenager, right? I legit don't have any reason to be depressed....

The only reason for me to be depressed is the verbal abuse from my grandmother but that's been going on for years since I was a freaking baby, that's just how she is. And sometimes she's kind and would do stuff for me (deliver my forgotten stuff to school)

Also my parents are okay. They love us but I'm not close with my dad and not really comfortable opening up to my mom but I talk to them daily and is normal. My mom sometimes is insensitive tho, like randomly she'd crush my confidence like she'd say something like I'm not pretty or my sister's prettier, my body hair is ugly and I'm so ugly after going home from school but that's just sometimes, most of the time she'd ask me how school went like happily.

My siblings are cool.

But I always feel like shit when I go home. Since we still have online classes, I always find myself stuck in my room and just sleep all day.  I don't even care if I get shouted at by my grandma.

I just don't have the energy to actually wake up and go to that building. Every morning I wake up and decide I can't get up physically and then I fall asleep again and a few hours later I feel like crying and I feel so bad for doing that and that happens every day.

356,t3_ypfu8b,depression,venting/stuck/lost/done with life,"I don't know from where should I start but okay. So my father and mother had an arranged marriage and my mother came from a decent and well-mannered family and so she was very naive and polite. My dad was totally the opposite and used to hit her and what not. My brother (6 years older) and I used to watch it and till now I find it traumatizing. 

My dad also used to hit my brother and he never had any respect for any of us. He would occasionally smile at me or say some fake nice sentence which my brother found very triggering and said that father loves me more. 

As I grew up, my brother got terrible anger issues too, due to the family atmosphere, and my father and him had huge physical fights where they hit each other a lot. My brother ended up beating up my mother and I too for around 2 years before he went to college. I used to lock myself up to not get hit. There were 2 instances where he accidentally or idk hit my mom on the head and she was bleeding like anything. At that time I was in 6th or 7th and ran like hell in the house to apply medicine. The next day I cried and went to my father to see mom's head and lied that she got hit by the cooler (because there was a need of an injection to be applied). 

After my brother went to college, no one talked to one another in the house, my mom got invested in my paternal grandmother who only used mom and never appreciated her. I was in class 9 when grandmother died. But till then, my mother's back had severe pain and problems. All this time, I was going through bullying at my school but I never felt like sharing anything. After class 8th, my grades felt and my world shattered because books were what kept me alive. I was going through severe anemia but managed to get my grades up and get back on track. Took science in class 11 and hardly managed to pass but my dad refused to pay for the tuitions since I refused to join coaching classes for competitive exams (he is a physics professor at one of these centres). 

Got through these 2 years and then lockdown came. My brother came back and the fights came back. My brother had minimized hitting my mom since he felt guilty but still had those 1 or 2 instances. He still used to hit me because I used to stop him from smoking cigarettes (only because he and I have had asthma and his was severe) or stop him from fighting just so that no injuries happen. I wanted to prepare myself for other entrances but due to the fights and getting hit and being called a prostitute by my own brother on a regular basis, it all got to me. When I tried to reach out to my brother and used to get emotional and cry, he used to slap me for crying because he thought it was weak. 

Once the fight got so insane (one day before the most imp entrance exam) that my maternal aunt had to come and take my brother away. He then spent 3 months at her home, working on himself. That's fine and I was glad but somewhere or the other, I always felt neglected. I never got a chance to work on myself in a calm environment. 

Anyway, so I never had any relationship as such with my brother. Obviously, never with my father too. I am the closest to my mom but I am still never able to convey my problems to her since she is disturbed too and she never deserved all of this. My brother regrets everything he's done and apologizes to mom now (not to me). On the contrary, my brother is gentle on the inside and does good things too but I am not able to take all of these memories out, I have constant breakdowns in front of mom since I am now trying to prepare for the most important entrance exam (while being in the last year of college). I am not in the correct mental state and am not able to focus at all. Verbal fights still take place between mom and dad and I can't help but listen to all of it regularly. My dad says things like if you don't change the light bulb it'll be my shoe and your face (though he never hit me) but it is still very disturbing. 

My dad also tortured my brother from the start like hit him and never give him enough money for his expenses, never talk to him nicely and always be the fucking toxic person ever. No one can be blamed and no one can be called right. But all this has ruined me so much. And oh yeah plus the 2.5 years of toxic relationship I had wherein I was made to question my worth on a regular basis. My friends have never been permanent but now I'm used to it.

It started off pretty well but some things happened and I fell into a depressive state quite quickly, stopped doing my school, and honestly just let myself rot away in my room for the 3 out of the 5 years it‚Äôs been.

ahhhh i don‚Äôt even know where to begin. This is a long one and I‚Äôve been holding it in for almost my whole life, so I apologize if it‚Äôs too much. I just need to dump some stuff.

When I was young, I was forced into sports. It wasn‚Äôt bad at all in the beginning, I only played recreational sports and yeah it was fun because of the snacks you‚Äôd get, the cool team names and uniforms you‚Äôd get, etc. My parents soon realized I was talented at being a goalkeeper, so they pushed me into competitive soccer aka club soccer. They dedicated 8 long years putting me through conditioning, training, and so much more to achieve professionalism. As I got older, I got more attention, but my satisfaction with the sport was going down. I‚Äôd have to endure mental abuse,sometimes physical abuse, from my father if I made any mistakes or showed any emotion after my team lost. 

I would throw tantrums of not wanting to go to practice or games, but in the end I had to go because my parents would threaten to call the coach and humiliate me. I‚Äôd cry during practice in secret and wipe my tears with my dirty gloves. Nobody would notice anyways since we practiced in the dark. Sometimes I‚Äôd cry in the car after a game after my parents told me how my teammate‚Äôs parents shit talked me during the game as if that‚Äôd help motivate me.

During those 8 years of me playing,  I realized now that it ruined my social skills and more. I‚Äôd never be able to connect with my teammates. I was described as the lone wolf by my coaches because of how awkward and unsocial able I was, which led to more berates from my parents since they accused me of having autism or whatever. Everyone in my team never wanted to associate with me and only talked to me if they were forced to or for teamwork stuff ig. I remember being invited by my friends from school to birthday parties, hang outs, etc. but always having to say no because of my dad. My dad only expected me to give my all to soccer since friends are a distraction, according to him. 

Like I said earlier, I got attraction and eventually did get to the point of almost achieving fame, stardom, and becoming a pro soccer player. Everyone was so proud of me. Everyone saw 15 year old me as a role model of working hard even if they didn‚Äôt know the abuse and mental anguish I went through to get where I was now. I was so happy knowing my parents would finally be proud of something I did. 

Until I got cut. My life tumbled down from there despite being only 15. I was called a failure, a loser, weak minded, and lazy for not becoming a pro and getting cut. I‚Äôm still reminded by them to this day that I could have been pro if I wasn‚Äôt depressed or lazy. 

After I culminated middle school, I moved to a new county, so I started high school with no friends and it fucking sucked. I failed my first class and fell into a deeper depression as the days went by. I turned to social media for attention since I was deprived from any love since I felt like my parents hated me and nobody considered me girlfriend material since I was considered ugly back then (still am and I was ugly). I ended up getting groomed by multiple older men and they managed to get inappropriate pictures of 15 year old me. To this day it haunts me how they were able to do that so easily and how fucking stupid I was to do that. I was still playing soccer at the time and that was my escape reality, albeit being unhealthy. 

I quit two years after I was cut from everything that would have guaranteed my parent‚Äôs love and praise. Now I had nothing to do with my life. I only did soccer and was never allowed to pursue other interests because my father only wanted me to do 100% with my life. I once again fell into depression doing nothing with my life and only playing video games till 5 a.m. and doing schoolwork.

And I attempted suicide. I attempted it 3 times in the same year. When my parents found out the first time, they were crying and I genuinely thought they finally cared about me. I got sent to a crisis center and once I got picked up, my mom told me that my father was arguing with her saying how he has a fucking weakass daughter and he hated me. The second time I attempted was in secret, it didn‚Äôt work obviously. The third time, I attempted and then told my dad I wanted to go to a crisis center for my safety. And he snapped. He slammed into my room, grabbed the hood of my hoodie and dragged me downstairs , basically choking me and threw me on the couch and start yelling how I‚Äôm fucking weak and don‚Äôt deserve anything for being a pussy. I remember crying so much after I gotten hit and my dad came in my room apologizing as if he didn‚Äôt beat me earlier. 


Time skip to me in senior year, it was awful . Although life did pick up since I finally got with my long term crush, it got awful towards the middle-last half of senior year.

I could tell his friends hated me. They‚Äôd call me controlling when they asked my bf to hang out with them and he wouldn‚Äôt want to go in general. They called me a bitch and horrible things. The way they looked at me during lunch held so much animosity. And it made me cry nearly every lunch wondering why no one liked me.

After I graduated high school, I was so happy to start a new chapter as my bf and I are going to the same university, all the toxic people were cut off, and my parents simply ignored me and never caused issues with me as much like before. 


And now I‚Äôm here, about to fail my first semester of university because of my depression. I truly tried so hard, but I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I haven‚Äôt been to class for about a month and I want to drop out. 

The thing is I know the inevitable consequences once I tell my parents that I‚Äôm planning to drop out. Another year(s?) of getting everything taken away from me like my car, social life, pc, and phone because my dumbass can‚Äôt get out of bed without crying or feeling anxious. I know they will hate me and call me a failure for dropping out and I will never gain the love of my parents, just as I was barely starting to gain their affection. I feel like a failure to my boyfriend as well and knowing that he‚Äôs seeing me go through turmoil rn hurts as well.

I just needed to vent. I‚Äôm so sorry if this was so unorganized or what not, I just have a headache and just feel horrible. Thanks if you read this though haha.

368,t3_ypdx63,depression,Celexa/citalopram sexual side effects questions,"Heya, so I have been on Wellbutrin for about a year but have recently added celexa to the mix to help a little bit more as the Wellbutrin was not enough. One of the things that was causing a lot of problems for me was my sexual performance. I was finishing way too fast for my significant other to be finishing the way I wanted them too. While this wasn't a problem for our relationship, it certainly affected my confidence and desire to engage in sex. 

When I started on celexa at 10mg, I found that this problem went away and that I was taking a lot longer to finish and sometimes unable to finish at all. While this was not the solve I was hoping for, it was a step in the right direction and i was okay not finishing so long as my spouse was. Now, after about a month on 10mg celexa, this problem has seemingly gone away; although, I find it happening once and a while, but then other times it's back to finishing fast. Has anyone had this issue where they only have the sexual side effects some times? I find it strange that it isn't a consistent thing and it is a bit worry some that I haven't noticed the issue in a few days now. 

I do have some anxiety issues about finishing early that often tend to be self fulfilling. But I don't understand the side effects going away like they have. I was warned that it isn't one that often leaves and I kind of want those side effects of lasting longer to come back.

370,t3_ypdqcy,depression,OCD wasted years of my life and nothing feels enjoyable anymore.,"Hello,

to be honest, I probably shouldn't writing this right now since I'm not a good mental state at the moment (I just had a mental breakdown). But I feel like there is not much I can do at the moment. I'm too stressed and emotional drained to sleep or do any other activities and all my friends are occupied at the moment.

For the past 5 years, I've been suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Just as quick summary, OCD is an anxiety disorder where you are constantly bombarded with intrusive thoughts about things you find heinous/disgusting/immoral/etc, causing you to constantly worry that those thoughts would eventually happen. Apparently, it's something that runs in my family and I guess it just developed late for me.

For me, I've suffered through a variety of intrusive thoughts, including physically/sexually harming women and children, k\*\*\*ing my family members or people I've gotten angry with, being a psychopath, and so forth. Essentially, I experienced the worst aspects that humanity has to offer in my very own mind on a daily basis. I worried that I was just this terrible human being that wanted to these terrible things.

When I was 22, I started seeing a therapist to overcome them. It took a lot of effort/tears/sleepless nights and many years of hard work but since a couple of months ago, I've effectively conquered my OCD. Anyways, I didn't want to talk about my journey with OCD. I wanted to talk the depression that resulted after overcoming it.

A few weeks ago I turned 26 and I suddenly had this epiphany that caused me to suddenly go into a depression. Namely, it was a realization that the life I'm living now is nowhere close to the life that I dreamed I would be since all of my time, if not dedicated to grad school, has been dedicated to overcoming my OCD. 

To start off, I dislike the fact that it took me years to become socially mature as a person. Why did it take so long? It was because for 2 years, I essentially locked myself in my bedroom or my office because I was afraid that I'd hurt people around me. I felt that I had the obligation of keeping people safe and so, this was a necessary action to prevent my intrusive thoughts from happening. As a result, my social skills did not develop in a rate that I found satisfactory. I wasn't totally shut off from social interactions -- I mean I do have friends -- but I didn't get to spend the time I wanted to with them because I was in a constant state of fear and anxiety. 

Furthermore, dating. To be honest, even though I'm 26, I've never once have been in a relationship. I know everyone finds their partners at different points in their life but I feel woefully lagging behind. Even when I was 22, I still felt bad. It's not that I didn't want to. In fairness, there is a numerable amount of reasons why I haven't found someone so far -- grad school, OCD, pandemic, etc. But I feel the biggest reasons of them all was my OCD. Had I not had OCD (of hurting women), I would have worked around the other limiting circumstances. Again, since I was having these thoughts of r\*\*\*ing/m\*\*\*\*\*ing women, I felt that I wasn't in any mental state to be dating. First off, I needed to figure out if I was a secret r\*\*\*ist; if I was, I needed to avoid women to keep them safe. Second off, in the possibility that I wasn't but was still afraid that I was, if I did get into a relationship, I rationalized that the relationship would have self-destructed to be honest.  I mean, no relationship is going to end well if one partner is afraid of hurting the other every other second. 

Anyways, even though I know now I'm not that type of person, I'm just left with the regret of missing out on that experience when I was younger. It hurts. I feel lonely, unloved. I feel like wasted goods. I see all my high school friends on Facebook and already, many of them have been a long-term relationship, getting married/are married, and/or even started having kids. Meanwhile, I'm just a lonely pathetic loser that will never be loved. And its not because of any of my own faults. If I didn't date because I wasn't proactive enough, then I only have myself to blame. However, it's because, largely, my OCD prevented me in the first place.

There are whole bunch of things I can get into but this post would get exceedingly long. But long story short, my OCD robbed me of my 20s and I hate it. I know now that I'm in a position where I can live the  life I wanted to but I feel it wouldn't be the same. I know life doesn't end once you turn 30 but being robbed of a life that you could have lived just hurts deeply. Everything I do now that I didn't do when I was younger feels 'not as good as it should' since I feel like I'm doing it for the sake of doing it while I'm still young or to no longer be considered pathetic. Like, everything feels rushed. Had I done it much earlier, it wouldn't feel rushed and just be organic.

To be honest, I don't want to live anymore. My OCD robbed me of my life and its not fair. I no longer find joy in life anymore. I'm in a constant state of misery and I just want it to end. I'm just a pathetic person. I'm just wasted goods. Honestly, I feel like the only thing that can fix this feeling is if I could go back in time and live the life I feel I deserved. But that's an impossibility and if I can't, I might as well be dead. 

I don't have any active plans of committing suicide but I have thought about it a lot recently. Paradoxically, even though I said I want to die, I don't want to commit suicide. I know my family would be devastated if I did so. I'm trying to make changes in my life to prevent that from happening but I know that if my life doesn't improve, I'll likely kill myself regardless of how my family would feel about it. I'm not sure what would await me in the next life. I could be bliss or it could be pure non-existence. Ultimately, I just don't want to live in constant misery in this cruel world anymore.

Almost every day, at any minor inconvenience I'll somehow blow up at it. I don't want to be mean, and I try to hold it in as much as possible.

I'm not funny even though I like to think I am, I never have any good storys, I'm overall miserable to be around, and despite the fact that I love my parents, I'm never any help at all. I have gotten everything my siblings haven't and yet I'm still depressed. What the fuck is wrong with me. Istg if I had a nickel for every time I thought about killing myself. The only reason I haven't done it yet is because there might still be people that care. If I die, I don't want my family to think it's their fault. Sometimes I'll stare off into space and suddenly the day is gone, everything that I had to do, just melts away. I'm constantly anxious about the future but then constantly regret the past, because I never stop to live in the present. And every time I do something even slightly wrong, my mind will become so cripplingly loud and yell the most hurtful things towards me, and then it pictures me being vividly stabbed.

The text itself isn't really formatted and pretty informal but I feel like it encapsulates the tone and emotion I was feeling at the time so I'm going to keep it as is:



 

&gt; i guess were posting these tn so while were on topic i almost finally got back into a relationship this summer like this chick was beautiful and she literally was always down to meet up and we would go shopping and literally had so much fun and chemistry, this was up in northern michigan and there's a lot of scenic places to go there so it was like literally something out of a movie, i remember specifically going to this beach on Lake Michigan w clear water and literally just having the greatest fucking time ever im not gonna go too in detail but it was a lot of fun. we watched the sun set and shit and it was literally the happiest ive prob been in the last maybe 2-3 years definitely since i dropped out of college. anyways the end to this is that I had to leave northern mich to go back to Florida and I promised her I'd try to make it work and see her again and the guilt just kinda built up and we grew apart gradually since long distance  can have the tendency of doing that especially when you haven't known each other that long... the story basically ends with her telling me how she was crazy in love at first and that it gradually faded away because of the circumstance and that it'd be better off as a memory, and ever since i tried to hit her up (maybe once or twice) she either responded dry or left me on read. All that shit was for nothing. it's one of the many things that weighs down my conscious every day, influencing the narrative that i will never be happy, and that i will get what i deserve in the end, even if those thoughts are irrational in nature. it fucking sucks. it's one of the many things that i can't get over, ive literally had dreams of those moments; of when the world felt a little bit bigger than it had before just because I was there, and she cared, she wouldve gone on a whim to see me and I would've done the same. i know that I'm young (20) and all that jazz but sometimes it just feels like i quite literally missed my chances and opportunities in life. it feels like a sick fucking joke, all of this.




I never really intended to make the text that long, but as I progressed into the story all of it just kind of poured out and it made me pretty emotional. Stories like this are what kind of influence my consistent, repetitive state of dysfunction. I'm 20, college dropout, about to pick up a second job because I can barely afford my apartment. I'm fucking alone whenever I'm not putting on a smile at work or at the gym (sorry, I am unfortunately a 'gymbro' lol). I guess it just feels like my time has past already; considering my age, it's a dumb thought. I go to work, maybe see some people I like at the gym, go home, and do what? Nothing. I try to go out, make plans, try to get out of the house, but it's to the point where I'm just a vaguely known acquaintance to everybody anymore, I'd be lucky to even get a response. 



I'm getting to a point where I just don't see why I should do it anymore, I feel like my life's at a dead end, my family was torn apart long ago...nasty divorce and all that but I'll spare the details, I have loved ones, but haven't heard from many of them, at least I can say I have them? That's more than some people can. 



I feel like a passenger in my own body, who would care if I died, or ceased, or anything of the sort? My immediate family I presume, and that thought hurts, but is it not in the human spirit to move on? To heal from grief? My memory would die with them, maybe my siblings as well. But eventually I would become no more significant than the grass that covers the ground or the asphalt and pavement that stretches a city street.

Now when i say drinking, i was drinking about 20 beers or so minimum, every night since i was about 17 or so, up until 22. I had a day leaving for work in the morning, where i picked up my co worker, and i had some sort of health attack where i had to pull over, i basically fainted, had some severe heart palpitations, and had this feeling of nausea and dizziness in me. Every day since then, i‚Äôve had this feeling, and this scared feeling in my stomach that this is gunna happen again. I went to the hospital a few weeks after cause after i quit drinking cold turkey, i was going through crazy bad withdrawals. Ie, laying on the bathroom floor shaking, constant nausea, faintness, weakness, etc. Its never ending now. Its been over a year and a half now of this, and i went to a consoler, and it just didn‚Äôt workout well, especially over the phone. i was prescribed pills &amp; didn‚Äôt want to take them due to side effects, i also have never been a fan of medicating. Now, i went a few months without drinking and it was way worse, to this day, i still get it bad, but some days i can push through and others i can‚Äôt. When i do drink now socially, after 6 beers i wake up in the morning with weak legs and such bad anxiety‚Ä¶ i personally know in my head, i over think &amp; think i‚Äôm gunna pass out or have an attack wherever u go thats new or uncomfortable or sometimes even just a place i go regularly. its ruined my friendships, my work, and many many other things i‚Äôve missed out on being a typical 23 year old. any help would be appreciated.

395,t3_ypb3wn,depression,Is depression like diabetes?,"I have been thinking about depression and how I am personally affected by it. I think for me the hardest part is realizing that not everyone suffers from depression. It has been a constant in my life from a young age. However because of the stigma of saying ‚ÄúI am depressed,‚Äù I don‚Äôt say it ever. But it is an illness similar to diabetes or chronic pain. I feel like if I would talk about it more, I might feel better. But it bothers so many people to hear someone else say‚ÄúI am depressed.‚Äù Also, the actions of others can be very harmful to someone suffering from depression. It would be similar to forcing a diabetic to eat food high in sugar. The problem is while most people know to not offer a diabetic person sugary foods, they don‚Äôt realize things they say or do or don‚Äôt do can be very harmful to someone with depression. For example, being short with me and not making an effort can send me over the edge sometimes. I wish people could see that I need them to reach out to me instead of me always doing it first.

Born into a lower class family where it was just my mom &amp; my four older brothers &amp; eldest sister.
There was over a ten year gap between me and any of my siblings &amp; they disliked the fact that well I was the youngest therefore I was Mom's favorite &amp; always got the special treatment so obviously I was the target of ""brothers being brothers"" which never really bothered me although I always cried like a lil pussy.
But my main escape from it all was Video Games, Halo &amp; Mass Effect being my favorite as I loved the idea of exploring space with alien friends at my side.
Growing up I chamged friends a lot, no one really stayed with me very long until high school where I found four friends &amp; we stayed together, until they blocked me after high school due to my views &amp; annoyance I guess I mever got an answer although currently we're back on speaking terms.
My dad is a literal druggie who somehow walks free today after literally murdering his best friend over coke(my mom has great taste in men."") So he was never in my life.


But anyway I'm getting off track so I'll skip over some details recently as a 19 year old male nothing is just fun anymore, as a kid I'd always come home after school and have a blast playing games or playing with my army men toys.
But every day I come home to the house me and one of my brothers share, I turn on the Xbox and just nothing, I stare at the screen occasionally looking at my phone until I go to sleep for work, I try going out but I never do anything as where I live there's nothing to do in this town unless you own an ATV or dirt bike which I dont, and I try going to the gym but I get no satisfaction from it, I just get bored after half an hour but I try to stay for two hours. 
Games nowadays just suck ass &amp; my wifi is to ass to run anything good &amp; my Xbox is to ass to run anything good, so I'm just in limbo of work, stare blankly at my screen, sleep, repeat.
And anytime I'm at work I just insult myself in my head, I call myself many many things every damn day and I keep telling myself to take my brothers gun and end it all but I've tried it before and I'm simply to much of a pussy to do it, I'm just so damn tired of feeling weak, stupid, useless, bored, tired. But anything I try to do to fix it all I think about is playing games &amp; how bored I am.
If I had my way I'd just cease to exist because I know I have a problem I don't Know what to do, my last psychiatrist tried to make me of safe places in my hesd but I thought that was stupid &amp; when I tried nothing changed.

No job

Low energy hence not doing much
Lost 25000$ gambling
No real life friends
Can't get a job- rejection after rejection
Got a bit money left then I'm homeless

I'm still surprisingly strong but like when do I get a break man... constantly downwards without any hope.

413,t3_yp9f35,depression,"If you suffer from depression and/or anxiety and think moving to Florida would help, read this first","So I moved to Florida from a northern state, and I experience depression and anxiety. I thought that it'd help those things but actually in my case it made them worse overall. I'll go into detail on the positives and negatives of living here and how it may affect you.

Positives:
1. Sunshine- it is definitely sunnier here than alot of places, and cus the sun is stronger here than many other places it can help provide adequate vitamin d, if you go out into the sun enough each day
2. Beaches- they're beautiful here, no doubt about it, especially in south Florida. And laying out on a beach will def help raise your vitamin d levels.
3. No state income tax- pretty great stuff, you get what you worked for.
4. Medical marijuana- med weed is a thing here and it's cheaper than many places, so if ur into that, then that's available here
5. Variety of places to live- Jacksonville is different than Orlando, Orlando is different than Naples, Naples is different than miami, if you look there are distinct differences between places

50/50's, positive or negative depending on you:
1. The weather- you either love it or you hate it. If you don't like lightning, you'll hate it here. If you don't like alot of rain, you'll hate it here. If you don't like hot humid weather u'll hate it here. The weather is cooler in the northern parts, hotter in the southern parts. For me personally, I find the weather often times kinda boring, so it's just not my thing.
2. Scenery- some people love the landscape in Florida, some people don't. I'm in the middle. Palm trees are nice, but Florida is *insanely* flat for the most part, so if you like hills, this is not the state for you. 
3. Hurricanes- depending on the category and the location, hurricanes either are a nice experience or a terrible one. On the coast they can be very dangerous, and frankly a huge hassle. If you're in the central areas, they are still quite dangerous but sometimes the sounds of it can be oddly relaxing. Schools close for them too.
4. Traffic- being from a much bigger metro area, the traffic here doesn't really bother me, but if you're from a small town you may find it to be pretty bad 
5. Lack of seasons- for some this may be great, for me I personally can't stand it. I miss the fall, the snow all that. The lack of seasons can make it hard to feel engaged in ur surroundings here. If you like pumpkin patches in fall, sledding and hot cocoa in the winter, u'll have a hard time here.
6. Seasonal depression- yes seasonal depression still affects Floridians. The days get shorter here just like other places in the US and there's less light, so it def is a thing here still.
7. theme parks/tourism- so obv we have Disney and Universal, and those parks are very fun to go to. But one thing to know is that if you move to Orlando, it is tourism season *all the time*. This means that u'll see hotel transport vans on I4, entitled tourists, etc., all the time. And so that can be cool at first, but the issue is it makes it really hard to feel like this place is home. 
8. Natural activities and wildlife- Florida does have some really cool natural things from springs, airboats, and all that. Alligators are def a thing here but they're usually really lazy and don't do much.

Negatives:
1. Cost of living- if you're moving to a coastal area or a major metro, Florida can be quite expensive. For example, an apartment in Orlando, somewhat near Disney, and not even in a good safe area, can be upwards of 2400 bucks a month. 
2. Crime- sadly this is one of the major things that has made my anxiety and depression worse here. Florida is weird in that, in the major metro areas crime tends to mix in everywhere here. Most metro areas around the country have a notable bad area in the city, and then relatively safe suburbs. Florida is usually not like that. Its very common here for the nicest areas, even in the suburbs, to back right up to a really bad area. This means that crime bleeds all around. So in many places in Florida, especially in the Tampa, Miami, and Orlando metros, it can be hard to fully feel safe. And trust me, no amount of tropical scenery and weather will make you feel better if you don't feel safe.
3. Tolls/spread out- in certain metros, Florida has toll roads and those add up fast. Many of Floridas metros are very spread out too meaning it can take quite a long time just to drive to a store that maybe took you 10 min to drive to back home.
4. The people- this one is another thing that really made my depression and anxiety worse. This does not apply to everyone, by any means, but it is more common than not in my experience. From my experience, Floridians tend to not be very friendly, and are surprisingly cliquey, especially in Miami and Orlando. People here just don't really wanna talk to you, or be friends with you, and honestly for me that was super hard cus I like being friendly to people and love to make friends. And if you go down to the Miami metro, many people tend to be just downright mean and aggressive. So it can feel very isolating at times, and again, if that is something you thrive off of, it doesn't matter how tropical it is, you will not be happy. 

If you read through this, and are considering moving here, I'd say to use this to make ur own pros and cons list and see if the good outweights the bad for you, and vice versa. And if anyone thinks of anything else, feel free to comment",0.66,1.0,0.0,1.0
414,t3_yp9a50,depression,I dont know how to get out of this,"I would like to tell you about my whole relationship

Me male (19) and my ex female (19)were together for a year.  She was the most beautiful girl and her character was perfect. It was the first serious relationship for us two. We broke up two times.

I am a guy who analyzes a person a lot before going into a relationship.  I rejected women very often because I saw minimal disagreements.  But she, she was just like me.  Of character.  The ways of thinking.  Her humor.  She was exactly what I envisioned as my future wife.  But she also had a few problems.  She was a sensible girl.  She was always very insecure.  She asked me countless times if everything was fine with us. She always was afraid I was going to leave her.  Because of her insecurities, I put so much work into getting her to feel secure and enjoy the relationship.  I always told her to communicate.  That she could always tell me if she feels fear, insecurity or anything else.  I would then make sure that she feels safe.

We kept the relationship a secret from our parents.  When she turned 18, I gave her a box of personal belongings and gifts and a letter that I put my heart into.

She hid the gifts in her room and her mother found the letter and pictures of both of us.  Unexpectedly the mother freaked out, tore up the letter and forced her to burn it.  Her mother hit her and said if she doesnt break up she will tell her father.  She is Albanian and I am not and because of the nationality the mother freaked out that bad.  My heart broke when I heard that and I teared up a little.  When she told me we had to break up, I started crying with her.  I actually never cry.  I tried to persuade her for a couple of days.  My older brother, friends, etc. spoke to her and she was way too scared to Jeep the relationship going and decided to break up anyway.  Eventually we both broke contact to move on. We met to switch back our hoodies and she gave me a letter because I did that for her too.  She didn't want to get over me.  She wanted to keep me in her heart forever.

We both went to the same school and saw each other every day, which made the breakup even harder.  We ignored each other when we saw us. One time I saw her run to the toilet right after she saw me and thats when I realized how bad she felt with it. It was so hurting to watch so I texted her and persuaded her to get back together.  Our plan was that when shes older and more independent, with her own apartment, studying, etc., we would tell her parents that she has a boyfriend. Me, all my friends and my brothers would support her during that time.

So we got back together We couldn‚Äôt see each other, because her mother could get suspicious.  It wasnt even possible to go for a walk because she was so scared that her mother would call her at that moment we are together.  I chose her anyway and went through everything with her.  At first I complained that short walks were not possible, but I accepted it. I was satisfied.  We whispered on the phone at night and slept with the call going to at least feel our togetherness there.  We left class in the middle of the lesson and stayed together for 10 minutes and I was happy with it.

We had a time where we often argued, but we got through it too.  I wasn't the most mature and often got involved in discussions or problems that weren't that big. I was the problem.  At least we always discussed everything objectively.

About half a year passed after the incident with the mother. I graduated. The relationship went very well.  Up to the point when she came back from her vacation.

This was 6 weeks before we broke up again. We couldn't see each other for three and a half weeks because she had to go on a vacation with her family straight after my vacation.  Phone calls were rarely possible as I often had no internet and she was with her family.  She texted me everyday how much she missed me.  How she would want me to stay with her.  How much she loved me. She sent me pictures of herself smiling and happy as she texted with me.  
She made a Spotify playlist with a picture of us two and the playlist was named ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget me :(‚Äú.  She was afraid I might lose feelings during the vacation.

When I came back after my 1 week vacation I started to feel bad.  There were some things in my life that bothered me.  An illness my mother got and I started to realize that my career as a professional athlete is no longer possible due to injuries.  I was at home a lot. I fell into a hole but always tried to stay positive and not let anyone see it.  My friends were all right back on vacation so I was all alone.  The only thing that made me happy during this time was the messages from my girlfriend.

Two and a half weeks later she came back alone from vacation and I picked her up. I immediately noticed that she was different.  I just thought she was tired, took her bags and we went to her house together.  Since her parents were still at vacation, we were able to be with together and spend a lot of time with each other.  However, I didn't have the strength to do things like going out.  So we slept and cuddled together most of the time.  I cried in her arms because I felt so bad. I told her i was going through things. During this time I realized that she was a little different.  It wasn't like before the vacation.  I thought the love has weakened because we didn‚Äôt see each other for such a long time. Because that‚Äôs how I felt. I felt less love being together.

After her parents came back, everything had changed.  She texted me less, called me less, stopped showing love and I didn't understand what was going on. Even after I asked her about it several times, she said everything is fine. But I knew there was something. 

A couple days later I told her I'm fine mentally and I want to know what is wrong with her. That was the only time i lied to her. Obviously I was still doing bad. She then told me that she had lost her feelings and wanted to break up with me. The reason she gave was that we no longer fit together. That it won't work out with her parents. I didn't understand any of her reasons. I was shocked.  It was like a gunshot in my heart.  I was upset that she hadn't communicated with me even though I always said it was essential in a relationship. She said she doesn‚Äôt have feelings for a long time and tried everything.

It doesn't make any sense to me. Does a person say how much they love you 4 weeks before the breakup?  That she can‚Äôt wait to see me?  That I am the only thing she wants? That I am the only person who can make her happy?  In addition, she talks about future plans 2 weeks before the break up. It felt perfect a month ago. For both of us. But i can‚Äòt do anything than accept it.

I'm 99% sure a part of him still likes me, but even then, I'm being pushed to the back. I know his little sister kind of set them up, and they got along really well.

I already survived war in my childhood, and countless Bullies (some of which were my own brothers), endured toxic violent and abusive family members. No friends, of course. No shoulder to cry on. When I talked about me feeling sad, I was always told to man up and stop being such a sensitive pussy. I found out about my sexuality when i was 11? And of course i panicked and came out to my mom, who naturally confirmed my panic and returned it. I had to do therapy to rid me of my ""sickness"". 
Anyway, I grew up to be that mentally fucked up depressed person i was always destined to be. At the age of 17 my family and I Left that horror of a country and found our way to Germany. Then, of course I suffered still even more loneliness and depression. It took so much time and energy and it was sooo fucking exhausting to blend in in this new world. Then suddenly, after about three years, my life started going uphill for once. And i started seeing some color in this black and white world. All thanks to my boyfriend. Younger me never dreamed of using the word ""boyfriend"". It was like a dream come true. I HAVE A BOYFRIEND I‚ÄôM THE HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE. (I used to fall for narcissistic hetero guys, who did nothing but hurt me)
It was like having a taste of god‚Äôs forbidden tree. I never imagined life to be so colorful, I shined, i was funny, for once an extrovert, I had motivation, energy, potential. I felt young and beautiful with sooo many open doors and possibilities in front of me. I even went to an acting school, since my dream has always been to become an actor (my boyfriend too) How perfect could it get?
Yet my depression got the better of me, again. I fell hard in that same blackhole when my mum got her diagnosis: terminal cancer. Not only that, many other issues started snowballing and there was no escaping.
Now, mum is still suffering, my relationship is so dried up it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me anymore. I graduated my acting school and put my certificate in the drawer. Now i work as a night receptionist (10pm - 6 am), giving me on top of everything, insomnia. I was planning to study media production for a more secure career.

I'm not diagnosed with depression and I don't think I'll be in a position to be diagnosed for a long time. I've been struggeling with feeling really tired, really low mood and having no motivation for coming up to 4 years now, and only in November of 2021 did I consider that the cause for all that is depression. I haven't done much research about it but what I'm experiencing lines up with the symptoms of at least mild depression from what I've read.
I'm trying to reach out online because it's gotten so bad I can't function anymore, and my college work/grades have suffered greatly because of it. There hasn't been one deadline that I haven't missed due to the backlog of work and I'm constantly pulling all nighters to get something out. It makes it so I'm anxious and guilty constantly but I geniunely can't find the energy to do anything but sleep. I don't want things, or enjoy things, and I've lost all passion in the course/career I've chosen. My hygeine has suffered too which makes me feel so ashamed and gross but I experience overwhelming dread at the thought of doing anything except stay in bed. Oh and remembering things too. That's gotten so bad. 

My biggest issue is that my parents can clearly see I have some sort of problem and have been hammering down at me about how ashamed they are at my performance in college and my obvious slips in hygiene and it's so frustrating because I feel they are the reason I can't get help and get my life back, but I can't tell them that, and I cannot fight the habits myself so far. I feel like I'm trapped with no options. 

And despite how much I want to pursue it I have a complicated relationship with the mental health system because one of my a-for-mentioned parents is a mental health nurse working in a ward. Despite their job they have very cruel opinions towards their patients, from what I can only guess is a complex they developed from their upbringing. 

Because of this I know if I was open about my feelings or my want to seek help I'd be laughed at and they'd honestly go out of their way to prevent me from making my own appointments. 
Furthermore, them and their co-workers have really soured my view on a lot of nurses in the system along with my friends shite camhs workers growing up that I can only dread what adult services are like. I'm also reluctant to tell my tutors about this because
a: They might notify my parents
b: I have no diagnosis so I'm unsure I would qualify for any of the schemes in place. 

So I'm hoping that anyone on here can share some wisdom on how I can ease my situation and my mental health without state therapy (or at least therapy that is easy to hide from my parents) or even just share their experiences battling depression without therapy or medication.

As someone who try to please people and especially my parents and their endless words.

I failed the year.. I couldn‚Äôt take any pressure. In fact I wanted to end it all, I used to cry every night. My parents got mad cuz I didn‚Äôt get high grades. And my siblings made fun of me.

I‚Äôve tried everything I cut all bad food I only ate rice and chicken. I‚Äôve lost 7 kg from my weight.. i stoped eating hoping I‚Äôll get better. But nothing worked.

 Not only what I‚Äôve been thru is still traumatizing but seeing other people live their life and doing the simplest tasks while I can‚Äôt do that it hurts. And my parents complains about it. They care about grades me than my mental or physical health. 

I‚Äôve been trying to convince my principal in uni to understand my situation and my stomach issues.

I made a decision to ""not speak outside of the family"" as they say, and my life got worse and worse, and the number of people who treated me badly, ghosted me, and turned a blind eye to my suffering grew and grew. 

I continued to try not to resort to speaking up about the abuse, out of respect of my father's wishes who didn't want to ""destroy this family"" (even though the family was already destroyed), so I tried to get through this without playing that card, even though it became increasingly clear that playing the card was the ONLY play I had. The only way to secure the support and help I desperately needed. 

And of course the pandemic happened. So everything got worse and worse. And now everything from mental health resources to hospitals to electronics repair shops can't be bothered to do their job, make you wait, and can't be bothered to ever call back to so much as give you an update.

She's been told to stop countless times, and she won't no matter what. Going so far as to leave, stand outside at night, and send in OTHER close relatives to try to guilt trip me into doing what she wants, while she stands outside by her car the whole time. 

Paperwork has been done about getting my father a caretaker, but, of course, we're stuck on a waiting list. 

The toilet needs to replaced. But OF COURSE, the plumber is too busy with other gigs to come over and fix it. 

My brother is sitting at home, on his ass, doing ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOTHING to help out. 

I already spoke up about the abuse I've suffered at the hands of my family on Facebook. It didn't work.

it's cliche, but i don't know how to help him without hurting him anymore than i already have. i keep seeing these cute tiktoks on my feed of positive pepes, and i sent him one but he just got irritated at me for treating his depression like a phase or a joke. later, i was hit by a reminder of how hurt i was when a friend told me to think positive thoughts and erased my messages. it's not my intention, but he frequently gets irritated at me for not supporting him properly, and i always get irrationally hurt/defensive when he treats me like this.

to be honest, all i remember from when i was depressed (from what little that i can actually recall) is that i always wanted someone to be there for me. but i can't bear the idea of listening to him for the fear that it'll trigger me, or bring back memories, or even worse, that i'll cringe. i don't know why i cringe when i listen to his problems but i do, like a total jackass.

tmi, but i was depressed for nearly 7 years, and i got through the majority of it by treating my problems as a joke, and basically gaslighting myself. (i know i should get therapy for this, but i'm not ready yet). i feel like i have little to no empathy for people when they are struggling with their mental health, and i totally acknowledge the fact that i've grown emotionally stunted. i frequently disassociated throughout my youth, and would experience periods of complete emptiness, and sometimes worry that this has morphed into my entire philosophy regarding personal mental crises/the crises of others.

a part of me feels like i've corrupted him, or that i've influenced him in some way to ""grow"" depressed. once, he told me that he would never forgive me for how i reacted when he first told me that he s/h, and that'll always stick with me. it kills me that i told him the same thing when i was younger.

i know that i shouldn't, and that i should be patient, and acknowledge the fact that he's going through something super difficult. but i get bitter whenever my parents treat him with the love that i always wanted. i find myself getting incredulous at the fact that he wants even more from them, and find myself hating myself afterwards.

467,t3_yp62d4,depression,Stress seems to be always be the overwhelming factor &amp; what eventually leads to a major breakdown,"I know everyone is stressed and that's just a part of being an adult while getting through life. However I just feel like I've been adulting since before many of my peers. All of my friends are with out student debt &amp; were offered support to get through college (emotional, financial). My mother died when I was only 19 and I had just met my father for the first time when I was 17. My therapist had told me I was essentially an orphan. I know she was trying to validate me and my struggles, however I began to internalize this quickly and spiral into negative thoughts. It was hard to see the positive for a very long time because it just seemed like everyone else had it, even if just by a little, easier. Whether it was by having emotional support from family members always willing to be there and spend holidays with, or the financial means to not have to scrape by. I thought it was tough to get by in college, little did I know it would only get more difficult to keep my head above water. It was hard to envision any future for myself. 

I am thankful for the loan forgiveness, as for me it will severely change the course of my future. It will allow me to finally not have to start out 10 steps behind of every one. I am always at the starting line. It's like in mario kart, when you hit the gas too soon, then you spin out. I am constantly spinning out just trying to catch up to where everyone else is at. (Obviously I understand others have it hard as well, I usually end up befriending these people and connecting because of similar experiences to trauma). However, I am learning not to compare my journey as I know my situation is vastly different. Despite knowing this, it's hard to not let the bitterness seethe through my teeth at times.

Money is and always was what weighs on me the most. It causes the most stress. Like everyone else, I just want a stable income and a stable home. I have been fighting for and wanting this dream since I left high school (back then it was mostly to get out of the severe abuse and toxicity of my household). I went to univesity, got a job in my field, discovered it was low pay, high stress, and very triggering to someone who's endured similar life situations. I got out of that. Worked in a restaurant for the winter, determined to figure out where to take my life career wise and how to support myself. Struggled with my ego a bit as I knew I was meant to do more, but just couldn't find my place.

Fast forward and I end up in a sales position (never thought I would be doing that...) and living off straight commision. The highs are high, and the lows, well, low. It's so stressful not knowing if I can afford my rent or not. I just want to buy a condo so that I can be investing in myself. 

Anywho, the holidays are approaching. My mom died 2 days before my brothers birthday and 4 days before thanksgiving. I now live across the country as my family life is pretty shit. Before I left to move across country, I had planned a going away dinner to say goodbye to everyone. Out of 12 people, 4 of my cousins showed up despite the other family members praising my little sister (who is actually their blood due to my step dad) and telling me I am just as much part of the family. 

Point is, I feel very displaced and hopeless. I struggle with severe anxiety and PTSD, so I am in my head quite a bit and can become very irritable. I think anyone would having to undergo the psychological turmoil I have since I was merely 3 years old, a lot of people do. I just feel lost, like I will never climb out of this poverty cycle. I'm busting my ass at work and there's not always a lot to show for it. Over the Summer I made a killing but now...

I figured I could save money and get healthy by simply eating less. But my life is so empty that I feel like the only thing I have to look forward to on a daily basis is that one meal.

My job is occasionally movement intensive but mostly it's restocking and sitting all day, maybe moving something heavy a few times a day. And in my free time I just sit in my room all day, doing everything I can to stop myself from thinking about how miserable I am.

I don't have friends to talk to. My family doesn't like me and I don't like them. I don't really want to play any games or watch any movies or shows, because I don't find my own company that tolerable in the slightest. I don't like doing or seeing something cool and having no one to enjoy it with or talk to about it. So I just stay home all day, watching youtube and playing games that are more to kill time than they are to enjoy. 

It also kind of hard to enjoy things in general for me because I have mental issues, like ADHD, depression, GAD, that, although I've never been professionally diagnosed with, they are sort of illnesses that you can tell without needing a diagnosis because of how strongly the symptoms present themselves, like a broken arm. So I just can't concentrate on anything, can't do anything on my own, can't enjoy life. Everything is so grey.

I hate eating, if I could I would never eat again in my life, but at the current moment, it's also the only thing I have to look forward to. It's my only source of happiness for the brief moment that I'm eating, but even then, after I've eaten I always feel disgusted with myself for eating like a pig.

487,t3_yp3ehv,depression,I think it's inevitable that I will end it sometime in the future.,"Hey there. I don't really feel like I have anyone to talk to at the moment, so I figured I make a post.
I've had a miserable day. The kind of miserable that is completely empty and devoid of meaning. Nothing bad happened. I just woke up completely exhausted, took my anti-depressants and wished to die, to not do this anymore.
I sleep badly most of the time, go to bed too late and wake up too late and exhausted.
I am a university student, so I'm basically always at least a little stressed. 
Thing is, I am almost done with my master's degree but I really don't care for it anymore. I don't really care for much nowadays anyway, but that's beside the point.

I also won't care much about working life, I know that for sure. Nothing I do is truly fulfiling, not really, and I don't think that will change. I feel extremely powerless to change my life, I'm not disciplined enough for an exercise routine or to adopt a healthy sleep cycle.

I have this quirk where I just isolate myself because other people are just a hassle. Now and then, like today, I wake up from my foggy thoughts of self loathing to realize I've pushed most people I would call friends away due to being too distant. Can't say I blame them. Can't say it's wrong, I feel so empty that I don't manage to care for many people, I don't think I've ever really felt close to anyone without being hurt, so not only do I isolate myself, I also somewhere along the line lost the feeling of true empathy, I only ever pretended I think.

I have a relationship, but she lives a few hours away, and at the moment she is too busy to help, she has her own stuff to deal with. My family is there for me, sure, but I don't feel like I can give anything back. My sisters are both pregnant at the moment, that is more important. Our family will grow, I'll be uncle soon for the fourth time. I still owe my niece a visit to the natural history museum to look at the dinosaurs.

The pandemic made it worse, I isolated myself further and I can't ger back out. Also the forseeable climate crisis, nothing good will come in the collective future, especially not in my individual future.

Every therapist I call doesn't take any more patients in, it's like everyone is depressed. I can't get therapeutic help, I already was semi-stationary, but it didn't help.

I don't know how long I can pretend to be okay. Like I don't think about ending it every day. I have nothing to look forward to, not even my relationship, that is going to fail sooner or later if I don't get better, and I don't think I will.

505,t3_yp18gl,depression,I failed my children and I will never be worthy of love.,"So the backstory of how I lost custody of my children is very complicated and heartbreaking and I have never publicly talked about it, partly because I feel I owe it to my children to take full responsibility for my failure to reunite with them and even though a terrible injustice was done to my family I failed to do everything in my power to save them and I will probably never forgive myself. It goes back to when I was pregnant with my oldest, I had very severe morning sickness and after doing a lot of research I decided to obtain a medical marijuana card and I told my OBGYN and she agreed that the edibles were helping (smoking anything is bad because of carcinogens.) Unfortunately my OBGYN wasn't there for the birth and the nurses called CPS who after investigation closed my case. When I was pregnant with my 2nd the house belonging to my baby-daddys fam caught fire! Because of living in hotels cps again investigated and immediately closed the case. Then contacted again by CPS because of cannabis at the birth of my 2nd. That time was best experience I've had with CPS. The social worker told us that she could feel our love and she was proud of us and that SHE was the ""hard-ass"" (her own words) that they sent to deal with the ""bad parents"" and closed the case. Well by this time our family of 4 was living in a tiny room at a cousins house (not my cousin) and they wanted us out so I took to FB to cast a pity-net because I was certain if my community knew that my children were in need someone would help us. Biggest mistake of my life. On March 8th 2020, the same social worker (the hard-ass) came to take my children and she was not going to let me ""fool"" her again. She deceived me into letting her in (I should have told her to get a warrant) and when I said why are you taking them? She said ""neglect, there is no food..."" I said you didn't even check the kitchen so she let herself back in and lo and behold! Everyone had got there EBT so all cupboards and the fridge was FULL. So now why are you taking them? She said ""neglect, that tiny room is unfit for a family of your size"" 
Then the shut down happened and I wasn't able to defend myself in court, I was kicked out of the ZOOM parenting class because of technical issues and because I knew that my dad would take them I pretty much gave up. 
Now 2 years earlier my dad used his inheritance to buy a house in another state. Well his manipulative narcissistic wife basically convinced him to get a house out of his price range with her help (huge mistake)  during the entire ongoing cps thing she insisted they would not help me and that strangers will adopt my children (while my dad is saying the opposite) regardless she requested again and again that I sign a release so that she could basically smear campaign me to cps eventually she agreed to foster them and I signed the release. My father wants nothing more in this world then to reunite me with my girls. He used to say when I was a teenager and would watch my little cousins that I would be mother of the year one day. He tells me all the time that I am the best mother for these girls. 
I would have been there with them 2 years ago but she has been doing everything in her power to make sure I don't. I know that she has been manipulating my oldest (now 6yr) into having severe behavior problems and saying that it is my fault. My dad just 2 months ago was going to covertly leave her. He would call me and beg me to get there saying these girls are being abused. I think maybe she figured it out because she hoovered him back and now she is saying that she needs to protect the kids from me and I can't talk to them anymore. He even told me that he knows that it's not my fault Im not there because if she wanted me there I would be there.

I really thought about jumping/rolling out of the car and onto the asphalt and hopefully the cars behind us will run me over. i thought about how good it would feel to actually do it. i thought about how my boyfriend would do one of three things; just keep driving, get mad at me for doing it, and or not caring about if i was injured. after that i thought about how the people behind me would be traumatized by my action. today i could have changed at least 3 lives; mine, my boyfriends, and the people/person i cause to run me over. when he merged in the lane where the grass was close to me i almost opened it again, it took every fiber in my being to stop reaching for the door, meanwhile as i am trying to not kill myself today, every muscle in me in screaming to do it but i can't do it. i shut the door hard and i looked at him, unbothered, unintimidated, and told him that if he ever told me to do something like that again, i was done. he did not realize the words and actions he was doing, he apologized and said it wasn't any excuse and he wouldn‚Äôt do it again. he said he's never dealt with suicidal thoughts so he didn't realize the effects of his actins until i told him. the thing that has me the most worked up is the fact that i'm mad at myself for not taking the chance to harm myself, i'm mad that i am mad at that. i am angry that it took that action to get him to realize his effects.  i'm very angry that it is all i can think about now. i am angry that i hate myself for not doing it. i know it is the monkey on my back but god damn the whispers turn to angry voices, then to yelling, then to screaming, it is all it wants me to do and that damn monkey will not shut up about it. im having a really though time today.",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0

don't know how long it will last but I'm trying to get better and even though it's hard I'm pulling through for my friends, my family and myself
Don't know why I'm writing this, maybe I just wanna get it all off my chest:
I cut myself sometimes, not deep and not that often but well I'm not doing it anymore
I did some pretty horrible and disgusting things to my friends and even though I'm still ashamed of what I did, the only thing that I can do is to get better and to show myself and them that I can be better :)
I'm not considering self-harm anymore and my suicidal thoughts, well while they are still persistent, they're not as strong as before
Maybe it all fails, maybe my mental health will crash and burn but rn I'm feeling better than most other days. I needed a bit of help from my best friend to get started helping myself but I'm for the first time in my life hopeful for my future and I'm truly enjoying life and what it offers me &lt;3

i don't really have friends in my classes and what friends i do have i see any of them maybe twice a week max. i know it's my fault because i chose to live kinda far away thinking i'd be able to afford a car this year (wasn't able to due to other factors). i just don't have the energy to put in effort to see anyone, and i'm not worth it to other people to reach out to or make plans with apparently. i think i'm just annoying and needy and people understandably don't like that, but no one will actually say it to my face straight-up

my love life is just really sad. occasionally i'll go out with a guy, and think that it's going really well, and then he'll just dump me or ghost me or stop showing any romantic/sexual interest. i've never dated someone for more than a month, and i don't really meet people except through tinder/hinge, which i know isn't that weird for my age &amp; being gay, but still makes me feel really lonely and flawed

my family is really messed up and i'm not close with them either. i go to college out of state, so i don't see them except for breaks. i love my brothers a lot but they're both a lot younger and closer with my dad &amp; stepmom, who i try to avoid and don't trust for a variety of reasons. my mom is caring, but i don't know how to open up to her about anything without running the risk of her getting mad. i think she also has a lot of depression &amp; trauma, but handles it differently than i do and doesn't understand why i can't do the same

i just don't know what's wrong with me that this is where i'm at. i used to be smart and creative and have goals and friends, but now i just don't. i have no idea where to start or what to do and i don't know what reason there even is to keep trying anymore",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

I wonder how long my friends will put up with unread messages and shallow excuses until they drop me completely. My friends are all kind and thoughtful people who deserve friends who make maintaining the relationship a priority. I feel like I'm letting them down in so many ways. If they knew how much of a struggle it is for me to hang out with them, I wonder if they'd understand or feel personally hurt? I dread meeting up with them and replying to their texts and listening about their lives. Finding the words to say is hard. Social interaction in general is hard. Figuring out the right face to make is hard. Knowing when to laugh or sympathize is hard. Meeting up in public is hard. 

On top of that, I have shitty memory because of my ADHD so it's hard for me to remember all kinds of details. I forget most of my friends birthdays routinely and I feel so fucking bad. It's extremely difficult to pay attention when they talk. I generally just feel bad for existing in their lives and I really don't know why they're still friends with me. It's so hard to fight the urge to never speak to any of them again and rot in my bedroom for indefinite periods of time. But like I said, they're all so kind and wonderful, and I would feel like an even bigger piece of shit if I left them hanging. Maybe if I explain to them that I struggle with wanted to isolate myself because of depression, they'd understand? But I feel like that conversation would end in me essentially saying that I don't want to see/talk to them unless it's convenient for me, which is so hurtful :( 

I just try to bear with it an pretend to be happy because even though I'd rather be alone now, I know it'd be pretty shitty if I didn't have any friends, even if they only know a fake said of me.

522,t3_yp00fq,depression,We Broke up because of my parents and I'm depressed about it all," TLDR: Parents got in the way of my relationship and forced me to breakup with my girlfriend of 3 years.

I actually posted a shorter version on Entitled parents sub but here's the detailed version

I (25M) was forced to break up with my girlfriend (23F) of 3 years because my parents thought she wasn't a good fit(They say she's a different race, they say she's fat and always ask why is her family always around us when that is not the case, they say that she'll cheat on me and so much more) for me even this really isn't their relationship and they really have no right to interfere in my relationship.

For context I come from a traditional African home and still live with them. I was threaten that police would be involved to kick me out had I chose her. I just hate the fact they gave me that ultimatum of its either her or me trust me that is the most horrible thing you can do to a person. I could've moved in with her but to be honest I should be the one providing for her and me staying at her place I really felt I would've been a burden since they're also going through a financial rough patch + her landlord wouldn't allow another person in their house. My older sister wont help me stay with her cause she says she would rather be her and her man, I've been applying to jobs and have been getting rejected so the job thing is out so I can get my own place, and as for my friends I wanted to ask one of my friends but they already housing another one of my friends who also went through a similar situation with his girlfriend's Muslim parents not liking my friend. For more context this is the 2nd time this happened and we decided to keep the relationship a secret but we both thought it was a good idea so they finally meet her and get to know her but They found out about about me constantly sneaking out to meet her but to be honest they forced my hand for lying to them and not being open in getting to know someone else especially one I'm happy with.

So I am really stuck here at home, my toxic parents assume they did me a favor and expect me to be happy as they are cause they said getting rid of her was they're problem they needed to solve. They want me find a super submissive women who basically be a slave for me(They found my girl dominating cause we'd meet every Saturday not knowing that was our agreement to meet then so they assume she's the one forcing me out the house) They still treat me like I'm 16 and don't see me as a man they say only when you move out can you do whatever you want, but they don't know that them forcing me to make a decision like this makes me even feel like less of a man cause why didn't I fight for the relationship. This thought keeps me up at night and hurts me a lot cause I know I was wrong for that.

We decided we still love each other and we would confide in each other but at the same time I always felt bad cause I really felt like I'm bothering her and that I messed up so at times a part of me wants her to be happy with someone who she can be happy with but selfishly I still want her to be happy with me. After weeks from the 10th of October yesterday on the 6th of November 2022 we stopped speaking entirely and I feel truly horrible why would I listen to my parents, why did I ruin a good relationship. The conversations felt forced and we're just pretty cold at this point, she posts a lot of subliminals on her statuses loathing men, and all that feminist stuff after a breakup and tbh I know I'm the cause of her outburst and how she's feeling. I truly hurt her and I'm guilty about it.

TBH I don't want to let her go its painful I cry when I think about her cause she was there for me, she was my friend, my lover and my comfort(call me a simp or blue pilled but idc). This was my happiest relationship(I know there will be others but they wont be her). When I self reflect I think this needed to happen in order for me to get out of this trap of a home cause, I still have no say for a 25yr old and still attached to this family umbilical cord. I wanted to go out a couple days a go and basically meet with her under the radar but my parents said I'm not leaving this house rendering me essentially grounded, I can't see friends or whomever even if I want to go out alone. My mom assumes she pulls me around like a lost puppy just cause she has a car and even asked if I Loved her and I did but she says that's not love because from their lens a girl chases a man not a man. but isn't a relationship like a 2 way street? I never experienced love growing up both my parents were in a toxic abusive relationship and not seeing them show love to each other, I learned how love works from my girlfriend.

What would you guys have done if you were in this situation? Is this the right sub for this long story??

524,t3_yozvi1,depression,"I'm a depressed, socially anxious/antisocial guy[25M] with no career aspirations and I don't know how to fix any of it.","Sorry in advance for the long post, turns out I had more on my chest than I thought.

I have social anxiety and dysthymia, basically I'm sad all the time and get nervous around people most days.  I just get depressed, anxious, angry, or any combination of the three when I'm forced to interact with strangers in more than a ""passerby"" kind of level. As a result, I've been unemployed for a while at this point (the pandemic certainly didn't help matters. If anything, I think I hate people more now because of it, but that's neither here nor there.) 

I recently tried to find something I could do at a local job training center where I got into classes for a remote career as a web developer. Unfortunately, no one told me until about a month into the classes that, even if we are remote, the industry still has a LOT of communication between coworkers. That killed any hope I had in a job in the industry, since even if I struggle through the group work and projects (which, I hate, big shock) there was no light at the end of the tunnel. I still had to work with people even though the whole point of me going into the industry was so that I wouldn't have to. I've already been struggling in the classes due to lack of interest, but now I just don't see any point in putting the effort in when I actively HATE the work. I literally only took it due to the supposed lack of social interaction and now I feel obligated to finish the classes that I hate, to go into an industry I barely understand, to do work with people I don't want to work with.

I have no clue what to do, I've been mentally struggling for the past 3 years to get to this point and it feels like all the work I've done to get better is all for naught. No matter what I think to do, I can't think of any occupation I'd keep for longer than a month without getting frustrated and either quitting or getting fired. It's gotten to the point where I have no passions, or even finding a reason to keep going anymore. My support system, mainly my parents, aren't very helpful either, not that I blame them. I've been stubborn, and shoot down every suggestion they give as an alternative career (grave shift work, grocery stocker, post office sorter, etc.) and they just get frustrated after so long of me doing that. I love them to death, and since I'm not homeless I have to believe they love me too, but they just have no idea how to handle me. And again, I don't necessarily blame them for that. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a kid like me either.

I just want to enjoy doing something that can make me money, but I have no idea what that is, or how I can get help in discovering it. The job training center had me take an aptitude test and every suggestion they had I met with disinterest or malice, despite having good scores in the ""ability"" portion of the scoring apparently (which makes me question the validity of the tests, since I did so well despite having no interest in any of the fields I did well in.)

I've just been angry and/or depressed with practically no provocation for the past few weeks and no one appears to be able to help me, they just point me to ways I can try to help myself most of which I try, and all of which don't work for very long, if at all. I can't help myself anymore, I just don't see anything worth helping, especially when I have no passion or work ethic for anything. I just feel like a fat, ugly, idiot with no ambition or reason to go on that no one has any idea what to do with, least of all myself.

529,t3_yoz5hm,depression,Should I tell my teacher about my depression?,"Tw suicidal thoughts, self harm


I have been struggling with depression since I was 13/14 (now I'm in my last year of high school and I'm 17 years old). Recently my condition has worsened - I have no strength to do anything, I cry almost every day, I even started self harm and I often think about ending it all. It sucks, because I can't cope anymore with studying, housework and literally anything. I don't have any friends at school, because I'm too scared to talk to other people and I have really bad experience with my past ""friends"". I really wanted to make friends, to have normal school life, but my asiociality didn't let me have it.  I was thinking about telling somebody about my problems but I would rather not say it to my parents or my friends. At school some of the teachers are really cool and supportive, so I thought maybe I could talk to one of them. I would like to talk to the English Teacher - I think that he could understand me the most. But it feels a little weird, because he is not my class teacher. On the other hand, my class teacher is cool too, but I would much prefer my English Teacher. 


*Story about my class trip*
I was on a class trip one month ago with my class teacher and English teacher. Two people from another class also went with us. When we arrived, it turned out that girls from my class wanted to be in one room with each other, and I was automatically assigned to these two girls from a different class. For five days I was feeling like I shouldn't even be there, that I'm just a problem to everyone, that no one cares about me or event want me on that trip. I asked my English Teacher if I could go outside in the evening, because I felt terrible in my room - these girls only talked to each other and treated me like a ghost ( I didn't tell him the reason why I want to go there). To my surprise he let me but said it's because he trusts me that I won't do anything stupid. It was dark and cold outside, but I was there for about 2 hours and I was crying, because I felt like my existence does not matter to anyone. Because of that I'm really thankful to my English Teacher, but he does not know why I went there and I want to tell him the whole story.


However, I am afraid of the consequences of telling them about it (of course I won't tell them about self harm and suicidal thoughts, because I'm sure that would cause me too many problems). I'm afraid they'll call my parents to school and find out about everything (my depression, etc.). My father will most likely laugh at me and my mother probably will say that I am ungrateful. But I don't know how much longer I can go on like this - it destroys me from inside.


What do you think about it?  Should I tell one of these teachers about it, and if so to whom?  Or should I keep it to myself?
And the last question - if I decide to tell the teacher about it, how do I start the conversation? I would feel like I'm being a problem, because he also has his own family and I would absolutely not want to put a burden on him. In addition, I would feel quite awkward starting a conversation. Do you know where I should start?

I think I‚Äôm depressed, but I don‚Äôt know how to tell my parents, especially my mom. I wasn't like this during junior high, when I was a high honor student. I don't know what happened to me, and I don't want to stay like this. School has been stressing me out since the start of this school year. I wasn't prepared enough when the school year started, and I think that's when it all went wrong. I don't have a proper schedule or time management for my school work, so everything is in chaos. I can't keep up with my classmates, and I know they all look down on me, and thinking that they might be talking about me being a slacker gives me anxiety. I am also afraid to face my teachers because I know they will just talk to me about how bad my performance in school is. I have a lot to say about my mom. My mom is also pressuring me to have high grades, when in reality, I can't even have decent grades. She's also said harsh words toward me in a way that she thinks is funny, but to me it wasn't, and if I tell her that her words hurt me, she will just tell me I'm being overly sensitive. She also always talks to me angrily, but I don't do or say anything that upsets her. I have a younger brother, and it seems to me that he is my mom's favorite. My brother gets what he wants the second he asks for it, while I get ignored because ""I already have enough."" I've been thinking about telling my dad about this, but I know he will just think that I am sensitive and weak. I am close yet distant with my parents; I talk about a lot of things with them but not my problems, so I believe that is what makes them think I don't have any. I would open up to them if they checked up on me every once in a while, but they don't. I don't open up to other people because I think I will just give them more burdens than they already have. I've been keeping all these problems to myself, and I'm afraid of what I'll do to myself if I can't go on anymore. I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was 15, and they keep getting worse.

I got through social anxiety. I can mostly talk to people. I can make them laugh and hold a conversation without too much awkwardness. Beyond that, though, I'm just not someone anyone wants to know. I'm not interesting enough, good looking enough, or a good enough conversationalist to be worth getting close to. I have no marketable qualities - a walking failure of product design. There will always be a better choice than me. I have to just accept that everyone everywhere is constantly engaging in value judgements, that I constantly fall short, and that I always will.

The thing is, I've already come so far. I've worked really hard, and I'm ten times the person I was even a few years ago. It's still not enough. I'm still alienated and inadequate. It doesn't feel like life is a competition against who you were yesterday. When I walk into a party and realise that I'm the worst looking person in the room by several orders of magnitude, it certainly feels like a competition against everyone else - that I've already lost.

I'm not good enough for this world, and yet when I tried to kill myself hordes of doctors and nurses declared it was their ethical duty to make sure I continued to shuffle on. How is that ethical? I want like nothing else to leave, but they forced me to stay. They have no idea what it is like to be fundamentally inadequate. They are so used to living with a modicum of value that the only way they can rationalize it is to tell me it's an invention of my malfunctioning brain, when really I'm the runt of the litter who in any just world would have been carried off to peace by predation or disease, rather than being forced to haunt a world reserved for my betters.

I‚Äôve been making new friends for gods sakes!

I promised her I wasn‚Äôt going to kill myself, and I am going to keep that promise, but I want to hurt. I want to hurt myself again.

I know I have my wife, I know I have my best friend, but the rest of my support system feels so small and there‚Äôs so much heaviness, they can‚Äôt carry that themselves. Logically I know it‚Äôs not as small as I think. But after the revelation, I don‚Äôt think I can talk to my folks. And my friends shouldn‚Äôt have to put up with my bullshit. My depression is just going to repeat itself over and over again and nothing they say will fix it, so I‚Äôll just be complaining. And they‚Äôll just leave like the rest. I love people so much but I can‚Äôt keep them. It doesn‚Äôt matter though, I guess. My presence isn‚Äôt important in the grand scheme of things.

The worst part is that I know isolating myself will exacerbate the issue, but when you can‚Äôt trust compliments and you can‚Äôt trust kindness and they just make the frustration louder, what do you do? No one should have to be responsible for me.

In 2050 depression will be human's first cause of invalidity. And depression is already human's worst ennemy. Because no matter what we had to endure in our lives depression can happen anytime. It's universal.

Depression is a thing inside yout head. It comes with dark thoughts that reapeat themselves, basically mental torture.

But your fight with it will be a lot harder if you don't talk to someone.

Here on this subreddit i know that most people would accept talking to you without any problems. And these people won't give you fake advices, won't judge you, won't say shit to you.

This is kind of cliche but cliche are things that are so evident we think it's too easy to say and unreal things. But i can tell you that if you talk to no one your toughts will just keep repeating in your head. So say what you have on the heart.

The transition of returning back to campus after 2 years of online classes took a toll on me. I expected it, but I was unprepared for how hard it would hit me. I have little to no motivation at all to complete my studies. I'm so close to finishing, but I could care less honestly. Everyday is a chore. Im tired all the time. I withdraw from hanging out with the few friends that I have. I'm getting dumber while my coursemates are progressing with their CGPAs, and projects. I skipped a few classes for 3 weeks straight (which never happened before. I was a diligent student.) 

I avoided my FYP supervisor for months now, I'm afraid of telling him that I'm not doing any progress because of my lack of motivation and declining mental health. I don't want to sound like I'm ""whiny"" or ""weak"" or making excuses. I'm thinking of deferring this semester but my counsellor suggested I just suck it up and finish the remaining 3 weeks of this semester. She doesn't think I'm depressed because I'm just ""trying to run away from responsibilities"", and I'm unable to articulate my feelings well enough to refute and say it's more than just that. I'm supposed to submit my softbound FYP thesis by this Friday but I have no results. I'm getting even more frustrated over my inability to get up and start doing actual work. But I really can't. I cry all the time wishing I would just stop being so darn lazy and super unmotivated and open the goddamn Word file. I wish I was as capable as my other coursemates. 

I thought of not waking up at all, or running away and dissappear. I've been crying myself to sleep for a few weeks now which was new for me, I hardly cry at all even as a kid. But it's like all the repressed tears I've collected the past 22 years of my life came out. And today I finally went to the campus doctor and asked for a referral to see a psychiatrist, who can hopefully give enough evidence/reason to the university management for me to defer my semester. My counsellor was there with me because I needed someone with me and she's the only one I opened up to about it. I broke down the moment the doctor asked what can he help me with. I couldn't speak at all and my counsellor had to step in and explain, I felt so embarrassed and mad at myself for crying like a baby. 

The doctor gave me meds to help with the lack of sleep, saying I was just too tense and stressed academically, and observe the symptoms. If nothing changes for the next 2 days, I'll have to go see him again and then he'll give a referral.

Im 19 years old and im currently studying humanoid robotics, living alone in Berlin and well off into my third semester. I'd also describe myself as a musical person as i play piano, violin and started DJing a couple of months ago.

Ive been diagnosed with ADHD and depression early on in my life, ive had difficult parents to say the least and most of my life i was on my own, which surprisingly worked out for me.

I used to go to psychotherapy from the age of 10-15 and that helped me for the time being, but then my therapist got into an accident and it wasnt possible to go to the same therapist i had always gone to.

My friends perceive me as extroverted, joyful and emotionally mature and for the most part of the last 2 years thats how i perceived myself as well, apart from having months or weeks where i just needed to be a bit on my own and survive it through my depressive phases.

Start of 2022, when i moved out of my parents place into a pretty shady part of the city, i started losing progressively more and more interest in things that i found joyful, like hobbies, meeting up with friends, raving/clubbing and all in all being a socially active person.This wasnt as dramatic as it is now, but i felt everything slowly becoming more and more bland and monotone and i honestly didnt know why (i still dont really know to be honest).

Im at a point in my life where i feel like ive hit total rock bottom. Im in financial trouble because of the government and have been living with an insanely low budget for a while now, which also wont change for atleast another month or two (but after that i'll be financially secure again), my relationships have all suffered great damage because of my depressive episode.

my cat is also going blind, due to which i have to pay for an operation which i cant afford, I was recently ghosted by a person i thought i had a great connection with and ive been sick most of the past few months.

Dont get me wrong, i have people that are there for me and people that love me, but recently ive lost joy in everything i used to cherish. I can barely eat anymore, nor find the strength to do sport or any activities that arent absolutely necessary. Also needed to start taking meds to even fall asleep, as im having trouble with that as well....

And I hate it, i dont want to live like this, i dont want to fall into a hole and suffer and just waste my life away. Ive always been able to fight my depression and get out of it, by doing the few things that i loved, or talking to the right person, but now i honestly cant remember the last time i really felt any joy in doing any activity and ive never felt this numb in my entire life.

My psychotherapist is back in action but i dont know what to say or write to her to get back into therapy, as i know that, if anything, that would help me.

I'm almost 30 and still live with my parents; and I lost my car because depression pushed me into this corner where I felt my only release and escape was to blackout drunk; making my life worse in the process and destroying a lot of the relationships I have with my family and friends AND to top everything off, my one true support system and best friend in the whole world died last year and I feel like I haven't properly been able to process the grief.

I finally had a nervous breakdown this morning after a night of drinking. I feel so alone, and unsure of what to do in my life. I feel like I have nowhere to turn and I have no one to talk to. I just  feel like I'm getting backed into a corner and that I can't really have an open dialogue with anyone about how I really feel. 

My life feels like a juggling act right now, and I just feel so overwhelmed. Sometimes it really takes everything in me not to want to break down into tears at school or at work; and if I didn't already know how devastating it would be to my family, I would probably want to end everything.

562,t3_yow0hq,depression,I tried living for myself. I no longer see a life worth living.,"I'm 19, studying a science degree at a good university. I thought doing it would make me worth something. That I would be successful and make my family proud. I've just realised it's another thing I never wanted for myself. I can barely keep myself together.

I'm gay. Was brought up religious in a homophobic household. Grew up hearing things like how being gay is disgusting and how they can't believe people like that exist on this planet. How it's sad a mother has to grieve when their son is gay. How a charity that helps LGBTQ+ teens reconnect with their families was a waste and that they should just kill themselves. They still don't know I'm gay. I know I'll no longer be a part of their family. I've loved them with all I could. I've sacrificed so much for them. But now I have nothing left of me.¬†

I decided to be celibate at 16. Until I just longed for someone to love me. I started¬†to accept myself and that I couldn't change for them or be able to for my religion.¬†I met someone online last year when I turned 18. He was amazing, kind and sweet. He was perfect to me in every way. Until the abuse started. He groomed me to perform his sexual fantasies. Made me feel guilty for the worst things in order to trap me in the relationship when I wanted to leave due to him cheating. He used it for his advantage. He tried to coerce me into having sex with 3 people without my consent knowing I'm a virgin and uncomfortable around it. He humiliated me by calling me his bitch and making me take pictures of myself crying and nude. He saved videos of me without my consent. He made me self harm and relapse and he told me how he masturbated to it. Tried to make me carve his initials onto me. Joked about having his full name on me and even his cats¬†name. Made a joke saying someone said he could stab them and leave them on the street as part of his kink to see my reaction. Had an incestuous relationship with his brother. Told me he had paedophilic thoughts when I told him I used to sext with older men as a bad coping mechanism. Discarded of me and lied to me. Cheated on me multiple times until I eventually broke it off when I finally had proof of his cheating, lying and manipulation. I was finally strong enough to break free. But I couldn't stop blaming myself. It left me broken. I've spent so long recovering. I no longer miss him. I know he was the monster. But every now and then I hate myself all over again. I left my religion because it made me believe I was being punished by God for being gay and pursuing it. I was putting myself through torture. I know it wasn't a punishment from God but it hurts because I know my family and my religious community would all see¬†it that way.¬†

I don't have hope for the future anymore. Because I tried. I really tried to be happy. I accepted who I am and I gave everything I could towards finally choosing myself. It took everything I had left. Even after getting through it, I'm still confronted with the reality that I am alone. I broke down crying once in front of my family when I first left and I had to lie and say it was university stress. I'll never be able to confide in them. It is just me. And I don't wanna be me anymore. I'm going to lose my family one day, the only people I've ever truly had. I feel like I'm always losing.

I know there will be better people out there who I can love and start a relationship¬†with. That I just need to allow myself to start again. Forgive myself. Stop hating myself for something I can't change. Stop telling myself my existence only brings pain. I need to change my degree and figure out what i actually want to do with my life. But I don't want to try anymore. I don't have the energy to try. No energy to fight the battle that took years in accepting myself again. No energy to form some sort of identity. I just want to be able to let go.",1.0,7.0,0.0,7.0

whoever takes time to read this, I totally appreciate it and I love you &lt;3

I have been diagnosed with major depression last year and have been suffering from ""some heavy depression"" for another 3 years before. Things literally went from worse to worser. I used to have a therapist, I was in a psych ward, I used to get medication, I developped a terrible eating disorder and an addiction. Nothing helped me. Since school started again this year I feel so weak and desperate. I'm only lying in my bed, crying and calling the suicide hotline almost every day. I hate feeling like this.
And it's not even that I struggle with all of the symptoms depression implicits as low self-esteem, guilt, not being able to sleep or anxiety. The thing I struggle most with is this deep sadness that just possesses my heart and won't let go of me. I really feel like I can't keep living anymore because I Can't take it anymore feeling so down all the time. I'm so sad all the time that I even cry sometimes when laughing about a joke that actually made me happy in that moment. I don't hurt myself anymore to punish me, I don't struggle with feelings of unworthiness anymore, I don't care about the way my parents make me feel anymore (most of the time). I feel like I beat the typical ""teenage depression"" and now I'm just being here stuck and feeling this huge emptiness and sadness I feel like I won't ever get rid of again. I'm only seventeen and don't wanna live my life this way.

I realize that only hurts me, but I fear involuntary hospitalization. Even when they give me other resources to look at, I just can't. It's fucking pathetic. I have what I need right there, but for some reason I can't help myself. 
At this point it's an internal struggle. Part of me wants to live, for myself, my parents, the 2 or 3 people who'd actually care if I was gone. The other part is just tired. Everything hurts, or there's nothing to feel at all, I'm not sure what's worse. So, now it's like tug of war with a complete stalemate. And as morbid as it is, I want one side to cross the line already. I want my attempts to get help succeed, either with counseling giving me the assistance I need or me finding the will power to help myself. Or I want something to push me over so I can end it.

I've been thinking about this for a while now, and especially now I feel this is true. There is objectively something wrong with my brain. I can't seem to function like a normal human being. Not only because I need pills to even get out of bed, but the fact that when I try to get one part of my life back under control, something else suffers. It'll suffer enough that in the end I've achieved nothing and maybe even are worse off than before.

For example, I wasn't able to hand in my final report for my study on time, so I had to come back to school for that after everyone else already has their diploma, meaning I lost out on graduation.
I've managed to finally hand it in, but at the cost of my mood (just being behind my computer typing reports takes so much of my energy) and the state of my home. It's a real mess and I just can't find the will to clean up.

I recently left a terrible job for one which I thought had less stress, which is did the first few weeks, but now I'm already starting to feel like I'm not functioning properly there as well. Eventhough it should be something I should function well in, it's what i went to school for. (I'm a cook btw) like, my sous chef is as old as I am. He's got a partner, worked in Michelin starred restaurants and now helps run this kitchen. While I'm over here, struggling with the job, getting out of bed and not letting my home become one big dump.

The souschef recently commented (while a bit drunk) that I'm kinda functioning less that expected and the chef kinda made the same comment yesterday. Obviously I'm distraught because I know I'm giving everything I've got in me. Literally everything. And still I'm not good enough. I'm at a loss as to what to do. I thought I loved my job, which I do, but not when whatever I do isn't good enough.

Then there's the stupid addiction I've not been able to get rid of for years. I try and try, again and again, but I'm not winning. I never do.

I've had more therapists than I've had friends. I've been in more rehabs than I've had jobs. I've been kicked out of my homes than I've been able to keep. I'd do anything to change that, but I can't. I've never been able to and I never will.

Thoughts of suicide have been popping up more and more these last few weeks and while I'm not at the point where I'm afraid I might actually follow through, it's so exhausting.

No matter how much I try, how much I think that I've improved, just one single trigger is enough to place me back into my broken state.

It makes me feel like all my efforts were for naught.

Maybe I didn't progress at all. I mean, I thought I did, but if that's the case, why am I back here again? Back into this dark and endless tunnel?

Many people told me not to give up. That there is hope. I just need to try to seek it out.

But I did.

And I'm back here.

I'm tired of trying.

I'm tired of feeling this way.

To a job which once brought me such joy, but is now another endless pit.

Perhaps my mum will try contacting me if I don't get home at my usual timing, wondering where I am. 

Perhaps work will contact my emergency contact person, asking why I haven't been coming into work.

Perhaps my friends will try contacting me, wondering why I stopped responding.

Maybe only then would they realise.

Maybe only then would they think about my words and realise how much pain I've been suffering.

Too late for regrets.

Too late for redemptions.

Too late to change my mind.

How a privileged person like me, living in a first-world country, with access to basic necessities and more would steer towards this direction.

When there are so many people suffering in this world.

Where they would probably be happy to exchange places with me.

Yet I sit here.

Contemplating death.

Contemplating suicide.

Not wanting to try anymore.

Not holding onto hope anymore.

I think that I'm just a shattered being.

One who would never truly be able to be placed back together again.

So I wonder.

Is there truly any point in staying here, knowing that fact?

My mind says no.

My heart says no.

It was my fault too. Hannah (not their real name) is non-binary and wants to use they/them pronouns. I was okay with that I was trying to switch. At least I thought I was.

For over a year I knew they wanted their pronouns to be different and I wanted to switch for them but I could never do it. It took them getting very mad at me a few weeks ago to actually practice and make a routine to try and change the pronouns.

A few times a day I would say, out loud, things about Hannah that used the correct pronouns. I did that for a few weeks. Hannah said that they could only think about the fact that I always misgendered them and worried that I‚Äôd never be able to get it right.

I feel like a terrible person. I was misgendering the person I love for over a year and I just never cared enough to fix it I suppose. I was doing it for over a year and I just didn‚Äôt care. I never appreciated what Hannah did for me. For my birthday this year, one of the things they got me was a pill bottle with fake pills in it and inside the pills has small notes that they wrote for me to read if I was ever having a bad day. I used it twice. Because I forgot I had it. Because I didn‚Äôt appreciate what Hannah did for me.

Me and Hannah aligned on a lot of what we wanted in life. We didn‚Äôt want our own kids, we wanted to adopt or to be foster parents, and I know that‚Äôs really hard to find in someone, that they don‚Äôt want their own kids. The plan was to move wherever I got a job once I graduated college.

The weird thing is that I am in love with life, I want to achieve so much and there is so much I still want to do, and even with holding on to these, I want to commit suicide. I have struggled with my relationship with my parent for all my life, and things have gotten very tough, and although I love my parent dearly, after so much struggle, everyone close to me, even my therapists have told me to cut ties with my parent. Even my parents brothers and sisters. Sadly my parent has lost many of his relationships along his life, including divorcing my other parent (whom I live with). However, even though I tried completely cutting ties, it seems like no matter what I do it is impossible. The divorce between my parents is very troublesome and heated and has been going on for a few years already, and this parent has argued that as their children, me and my brothers/sisters had to actively take part in the issue, and defend what is ours (meaning the assets to be distributed, as at the end of the day it would be our inheritance). I got to the point at which I have told my parent various times that I would have no problem in renouncing from my part of the inheritance. We are however still legally linked in a few matters though, which has made it extremely difficult to completely cut my parent from my life. Including, e.g. education costs and a small asset which we own together, which was a gift that my parent gave me a few years ago just in case something ever were to happen, which now I manage but my parent still wants to be a part of as my other parent has not yet signed off the complete passing of the asset to me in the divorce (however, as I say I am taking care of it.). I am now abroad for my studies and have not held much talk with my parent for a few months, however, everytime there is contact, my parent has not been very pleasant, and throughout life I have felt extremely criticised by my parent. This includes critiques, insults, screams, etc. After a point I just stopped answering everything my parent told me as it was just a repetition of these insults or critiques, and even though I know my parent cares for me, it is the way in which my parent projects this that is hard. When I told my parent I was suicidal my parent screamed at me, called me a liar, and unjust, remarking that it was also unfair that my parent would then have to tell my other parent about my death. When a few years later, I once again tried to cut myself from all divorce matters, I cited lots of psychological research, even asking my therapist to talk to my parent, and having a psychological researcher guide me through all the research I could show my parent for my parent to understand just why I did not want to form part of the divorce. My parent disregarded this and once again got very mad. I have never felt enough for my parent, and have always been compared and critiqued for being different. I however, am tranquil with my way of being and have found the way to be happy as I am, knowing I am not perfect and striving to be just a bit better as a person each day, however now it is not even the fact that it hurts to be in this loop. It is just tiresome, draining, and sadly, I really do want to kill myself. Nonetheless, I have accessed even more emergency services as I know I want to achieve. more things in life and I know that I want to keep going, but at the same time I dont want to keep going, I am just afraid that if I once again try to commit suicide, I might fail and end up worse than before.

Recently, I‚Äôve been on Effexor 75mg for 2 weeks, which worked great until around the 10th day. I‚Äôve been augmented to 150 mg, which is working well. But the problem is that I feel drowsy, not alert, fatigued, sleepy and foggy. 
Have somebody experienced that? Have you been prescribed something to counter that off ? 


I thought of bupropion which have a stimulant effect, but still don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the usual solution to that.

I'm a straight A student with the most supportive friends and family, growing up in a asian family. My life seems great, but fuck man I feel so lost. My entire childhood I grew up thinking my entire family was poor, as my parents would save every last penny. I lived frugally and barely asked for anything from my parents understanding the financial struggles they might be going through. I've lived my entire childhood going to church every sunday and I knew that my parents contributed weekly to the church's donations. However, one day I found a check lying around donating a couple hundred dollars to the church, which I later would find out is the norm later. My entire life felt like a lie past this point‚Ä¶ other kids would get consoles, new phones, designer clothes, for their birthday while I would lie to my parents saying I was past the age for cakes. Secretly I did not think it was wise to spend 60 dollars on a cake. It has even come to a point where I would hesitate to spend 10 dollars at the subway on a sandwich I could make for way less, and honestly some days I would rather save the 10-20 dollars than eat at all. Due to my recent habits of being such a picky eater my parents would make me in charge of coming up with the groceries list of food I want to eat. Today, while my dad was grocery shopping he called me asking what I wanted for dinner, and lunch. I'm so pathetic for not wanting to spend a couple dollars on a baguette. It feels like my entire life is just driven by money to the point where if I ended up being anything other then a millionaire I would rather commit suicide. Last week, my mom brought me to buy a burrito bowl, thinking that I would hopefully eat more. I hesitantly ordered my food so as not to disappoint my mom. While my mom was paying for the meal she handed me a 20 dollar bill saying it's just some money for me to spend. I went home and cried myself to sleep that day. At school, I have many close friends in all my classes and I'm hitting a low A in all of them. Within my friend group and family achieving a A in class in the normal and if I really wanted to enter university I would need to be approaching a 95 percent. It feels like if I dont go to the one good university near me which requires a 95 average to be a somewhat guaranteed entry my life will fall apart. Originally, I genuinely wanted to just let my life play out and if I failed my admission I would just commit suicide. I would life the last uncertain year of my life in bliss, enjoying it and leaving my university application to pure fate. I have nothing to life for my entire life, other then simply money. I have nothing tying me down to this pathetic life, other than the hopeful prospect of making money and being able to be happy. I honestly don't know why I'm writing this at 4am while crying. My entire life feels like a lie built around money. I am someone who has everything yet ‚Ä¶ I have nothing meaningful to live for. My life is pathetic and my self worth makes me hesitate to spend money on food. For the past half a year I‚Äôve gone from someone who went to the gym weekly, and participated in multiple sports including kickboxing, swimming to someone whose been regularly sleeping less than 3 hours a day even pulling all nighters for extended periods. I‚Äôve noticed signs that my body is starting to break down on me, the pain in my wrists when I try to complete a single push up, the stomach aches I get from not eating, the headaches I get from not sleeping.

664,t3_yoknmg,depression,Fish don't realise they are in the water,"How would you make a fish realise he is in the water? Yes, you feel really, really bad, your thinking is extremely negative, or you are constantly worrying about everything, or you barely do anything all day,.. but how could it be otherwise? If you have a mental health issue such as anxiety or depression, then it is only normal to experience the symptoms, and changes in thinking and behaviour you are currently experiencing - they are literally what it means to have that particular mental health issue. Mental health 'illnesses' are something to be seen as a specific psychological adaptation, meaning a set of cognitive, somatic and behavioural changes part of our genetics that become activated in certain circumstances, and the changes you see in yourself are what would happen to anyone for who this mental health issue becomes activated. 

If you want to see the water that is all around you, you need to find out which specific mental health illnesses you have by either getting yourself diagnosed or doing a self-diagnosis.  That way you can make a full list of the symptoms/characteristics changes associated with that mental health disorder - that is the water you are in. As soon as you feel worry coming up, or becoming irritable, or any of those characteristic changes associated with the illness you have, you then know what is going on, and merely identifying it should be enough to make you take a step back and see that this is just part of the condition you have and as strange as it sounds, that should stop the worrying or negative thinking.  

So whenever you feel you start to worry again, or think negatively, rather than going into the content of the thoughts and trying to stop the worrying or calm down the negative thinking, immediately take a step back by realising that you are in the water, and that worrying or negative thinking, or becoming quickly irritable, are normal characteristics of a specific mental health disorder. The biggest problem is what happens when you are not aware you are in the water: when you start to engage with the content of the the worry and the negative thinking.

People adjust to their way of thinking, feeling and behaviour and it quickly becomes a new normal for them, they think they are their thoughts, feelings and behaviour, while they are just characteristic changes that are part of a mental health disorder. For many people worrying is just normal, and it becomes their way of living; same with their negative thinking, they think everything they believe is the truth (all the negative beliefs they hold), and do not realise their specific thoughts, actions and feelings (the water) are normal symptoms or byproducts of specific mental health disorders.

An important side note is that developing this awareness of being in the water is a skill in and of itself. Many people with depression have developed such an ability for negative thinking they automatically start thinking negatively about everything, and people with worry worry about everything: they fear about the fear not going away, they have anxiety about their negative thinking, or negative thinking about anxiety, worry about worrying too much, or worrying that nothing will works, .. and what might be even the most tricky thing off all, they have negative thinking, worry and anxiety that is reactive: even if they become aware of a certain worry and they see that it is part of generalised anxiety disorder, they would start to worry about that too in some way (e.g. ok but how does merely identifying it solve the problem,.. ) and so there is this constant reacting with worry and negative thinking-effect that is extremely tricky to catch, but again,.. with all time awareness and by relentless focus on realising you are in the water, you are always able to take a step back, looking at your thoughts, behaviour and action, and then you see that ' reactive worry and negative thinking' is also just a form of negative thinking or worry, and part of the characteristics of a your mental health disorder.",0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0

If anyone can help me with this , it willl be something i will be grateful to you my entire life . And I am telling you before hand , this is going to be very long as the time passed has also been very language . And English is not my first language , so pardon if I make any mistakes . This is a plea from a fellow human to another human. Ok so here it goes :


I am a 22 year old male from India. Only child , live with mom and dad . So few years back I got the knack of becoming "" confident"" . Like i would try my best to become confident . Because i was always this huge nerd and everything , so i thought i needed to be "" confident"" and everything to get girls , get popular etc. So that time i was perfectly fine mentally , or i think so . Then after sometime , i searched the internet for "" how to become confident"" and obviously got a thousand results . I got into those video , how to become "" alpha male"" and shit like that . Imagine a 17 year old boy trying to become an "" alpha male"" . There were these youtubers , a lot of them who taught you how to become one and get girls get popular , basically dominate everyone . So i got involved in them . Trying new clothes new everyday , styling my stupid short curled hair every day for hours , clicking pictures of hair etc . Alongside i got involved in something called "" subliminials"" . You can search that stuff on youtube . There were thousand of them . They claim to make your eyes turn green , grow a beard , change your height , even your face . I know it sounds ridiculous but hey you can go to youtube right now and check them for yourself . There are thousand of comments below the video about their results too . And I being a stupid 17 year old thought they were real , and started listeining to them . For hours in a day . Even when sleeping i would plug them in my ear etc. Because they claimed the longer you listened to them , the better the results . And i thought what better time than 8 hours of sleeping right . Then obviouslyafter  few months I realized what a fucking waste of time they were . I was even doing face change subliminal! My self esteem was so low , maybe because of racism , as some may know in india fair skin is regarded as best so for years friends and everyone called me dark and brown and shit. I used to look at the photo of a guy from school who was supposedly a ""chad"" , had girls played football . Then i got into afiirmations , saying "" imconfident "" , "" im goof looking "" "" im the best"" in front of a mirror . Didnt help . But what it did fucking do is make me obsess over this shit . This whole confidence charade . I read so many self help books , motivation books , body language books . I was fucking kearning to how to even keep a hand in front on someone . And then at the end what hapoened . I became a fucking robot just thinking where to keep a hand , how to place my legs and all . I think i got more anxious when trying to be "" confident"" . You have to understand im a single child , mom is a professor , dad is a manager . So i always came from a very studious family . educaiton was always of utmost importance. So i replaced all that time i spent on education and tried "" transforming "" myself. Im writing everything in commas as i find this even so cringe to write . ok now move on to the part which is really fucking my life . Im an idiot with an internet connection . When i was around 16 , sometime when watching youtube my hand twitched , i weeeeent on internet and BAM!!!! ALS!!!! . Next few months were spent searching forums and watching videos how i will live now that i have ALS . Talking with my friend on phone and imagining i have pain in my hand . And when exams came , i forgot about this ALS thing and in 2 months i realised where the fuck is ALS now . I think they call it hypochondria or health anxiety . See , i know everything about this shit . This is my behavior . If i am feeling lazy about starting a podcast or even writing this post , goddamn i have ADHD , will go on net and read how now i have to adderall and stimulants . I used to roam on my two wheeelers and listen to songs while riding or i will pace around and back in my room while listieng to songs and imagine shit , ok BAM now i have MALADAPTIVE DAYDREAMING . Some chest fat , GYNOCOMASTIA . some sadness DEPRESSION . Now i need paxil and luvox and therapy . I pathologise every fucking thine in my body . I feel like a idiot . People my age are fucking girls , driving cars and parties and club and here i am a fucking medical specimen . Please tell me what to do . Like als last time , this whole confidence and social anxiety thing became huge in my mind and right now ky biggest agenda is social anxiety . I dont even know if i fucking even have it or not . So much fucking time wasted in all this . So much time . I could have done anything in all this time . But now I AM A MEDICAL SPECIMEN! I yesterday got my first therapy session but In india its a joke. I didnt felt anything magical . She just charged me so much for talking for just 45 fucking minutes . Ive been to a psychiatrist thrice . Been on luvox for a month . Didnt felt shit . so many diseases in one body . please tell me how to man the fuck up. Please. Help.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
672,t3_yoj75i,depression,Never considered myself to have depression but here goes,"TW: Light mentions of Domestic Abuse, no details. 

Whenever I (27f) talk about highly painful emotional events, I feel totally apathetic, and I get this stupid grin, even though I'm not happy about what's happened. I can't help it. like some sort of weird Milgram reaction. Like hey, my life's an onion let's peel back another layer of pain. 

Anyways I don't cry. I have talked about my past with friends and I've had them in tears. But I feel like I'm talking about the weather or like it happened to someone else. I am so detached from it.

I would say I do have a tendency to be sensitive sometimes and as a child, I cried a lot. But I cried then because I didn't understand. Processing it as an adult hits differently. 

I cried yesterday over something that doesn't matter at all. A  few tears escaped after watching Disney's Christmas Advert and it really got me thinking. I cried 2 years ago when my Dad had our family dog put down. I cried at the betrayal of a friend. In this instance, I was absolutely gutted and completely devastated. Like if this person could do this to me, anyone is capable of anything. I WANTED to feel sad, I wanted to cry. I still don't think I cried anywhere near as much as the gut-wrenching pain I felt. 

But I haven't cried since leaving the abusive relationship earlier this year, I know I've had blackouts and have had flashbacks. I don't know if there is more that I can't remember. I haven't cried since learning the truth about my past. 

So I guess what I'm asking is, does this sound familiar to anyone? When the GP asked me if I feel depressed, I didn't think I did. I can still experience joy, I'm reasonably content most of the time as long as I don't let my thoughts wander. I will still zone out and people will ask me if I'm okay. 

This has been this way for years. I was in this abusive relationship for 6 years and have been out for almost 1 and that is the entirety of my 20s thus far. I don't feel like I know any different.

679,t3_yoipy3,depression,i‚Äôm very tired,"hi. i don‚Äôt really expect anyone to read all of this but i just need to process this somehow. 

i really don‚Äôt like myself. i would say ‚Äòhate‚Äô but that feels like too strong of an emotion when i don‚Äôt think i am even worth being hated. there is something about myself that i am disgusted with but that is ultimately not worth any effort to truly hate. i can‚Äôt even hate myself i just don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm am worth anything. i don‚Äôt even think i‚Äôm that bad of a person, there is just something about me that is wrong. 

i have always had trouble making friends, i personally think that they can sense there is something wrong with me. i try to be nice, i think i‚Äôm a pretty empathetic person but i just cant connect to people. i can listen to people tell me their whole life story and i will feel for them, but i still feel so distant from them. 

i didn‚Äôt even have a particularly terrible childhood. i mean things sucked sometimes but i was never hurt. i was clothed and fed and my parents tried their best. 

my older sister hated me when we were kids, but stopped being hostile to me when we were in high school. she used to be the person i was closest to but even then, she never really even liked me. she stopped talking to me when she went to college. 

my younger sister also didn‚Äôt like me when we were kids, but she now talks to me more. i think the only reason she talks to me though is that she hates my parents and older sister, but she can tolerate me. she only really talks to me when something is going on with her. 

my parents are pieces of work due to trauma when they were kids but they tried their best. they were worse when i was kid but they got a lot better when i was a senior in high school. i‚Äôm happy that they got better but i resent them because i think they fucked me up. 

i have exactly two friends. one only talks to me because i‚Äôm the only one they knew that was going to the same college. the other friend likes my other friend more than me which i understand. 

i told my therapist this and she told me that i didn‚Äôt know that they didn‚Äôt really like me. i guess that can be true but i genuinely don‚Äôt think it is. there is no substance to me so i genuinely don‚Äôt know what about me they would care about. i‚Äôm not even a particularly good friend so it‚Äôs not like they like me for that.

682,t3_yoinbl,depression,I'm so lonely,"24M. I haven't shared my true thoughts with anyone in years. Sometimes, they do come out when I'm in a fit/rage but my friends usually laugh and just dismiss them. Something similar happened in undergrad and a video of me raging went viral across college in undergrad. After that I decided not to trust anyone with my feelings. 

My asian parents think I'm some innocent golden child who will never stray off the beaten and moral path. The truth is, I really really really don't give a fuck about their morals(why is going out and having fun ""bad""). Their view is that I should go to sleep early at night, have zero socialization and excel at everything I do(because it's good for their 'societal reputation'). So far, ig I have atleast checked the last point (did my undergrad in CS, worked at FAANG, started grad school at a top institute in the US), but at what cost? 


I have minimal social skills. I absolutely suck at small talk. I was bullied a lot in high school(embarrassing to admit but even high schoolers younger than me used to bully me). Could never muster courage to speak to a girl. Wasn't blessed in the looks department too - every girl I even randomly met would just show me a face filled with disgust and move away. But that was still ok, I had an interest in academics - so I focused on studying. There was literally nothing else to do, my parents had sold off the TV in my eighth grade(so that I wouldn't be 'distracted'), and didn't allow me to buy a smartphone. All said and done, I still gained admission into a good college in my country. 

Undergrad was going good for 2.5 years. Then fucking covid hit, and I was back at home. Everything went online - including my internship and  my actual job. The next 2.5 years were a deep dark hole, working/studying from home while accommodating my parents requests. In my house, I also act as an unofficial psychologist. My parents fight a lot, and usually I'm the one to break up the fight and act as a therapist(my parents don't believe in psychology). One such time, my dad threatened to jump off a window(we live in a high rise apartment). That was obviously avoided, but I was too shocked to say anything - I just went for a run outside. 

I decided enough was enough, and decided to focus my time on academics again. Applied for grad school and got selected. Was elated to be working on novel stuff (a welcome change from my job). Also was so happy initially to just get away from home. But that's not the end is it? 

Zero social skills. I am still too scared to come out and casually greet people here(despite everyone I've met so far being so nice). Add this to the mix, I would atleast have a small group of friends to talk to back in my country(even if I was a fifth wheel, I could still tell them something and they would pretend to listen). Here, there is absolutely nothing. Again, I'm too scared to talk to girls because of the way I've seen my mom act - she seems so angry all the time despite me trying to make her happy, how much should I do? 

I do realize that this is my fault, and keep trying to get better. But it is so hard. Add this to the fact, with no one to rant to, my academics(the only thing I liked which has always supported me) are taking a hit. I really don't know what to do but cry.",0.67,1.0,0.0,1.0

Got no friends. Know plenty of people, most of them talk about what we discuss with others and honestly i dont even wanna hangout. Im tired of going to clubs or for a casual coffee and i suck at fishing so no point in doing anything

My fuckin gf of 2 years which i adored and gave me purpose in life, lied to me again. For bullshit stuff, like how many guys she slept with or how long she was with them. But ive exposed her before 3 times and each and every, she swore she wouldnt do it again and that now she came completely clean. Now, she says the same but since the last time something broke inside me, i just cant look at her the same, even though i still love her. I cant trust her and ive explained in myriads of ways why i dont care about the stuff she is lying about and why honesty is key in a relationship

Last time i exposed said gf for lying, was a month ago. We broke up. I started going clubing and attending social events at every chance given. I started abusing alcohol and prescription medication. I found 2 girls in this timeframe. Couldnt feel anything, couldnt even enjoy the sex. The one which im still seeing, also lied to me about dumb stuff even though she knew of my experience and ive asked her to he honest. So tired of people

My life has been sad and miserable for the most part. Im a good looking individual, well paid, respected, know plenty of people and seems like everyone knows me around here because of my job

Im so tired. My ex really gave me something to dream of. A house, a family, a future. Now im all alone among strangers. I dont wanna have sex, i dont wanna get high. I just wish she wouldnt have lied and we could still be together, we were such a great match. I know itll pass this feeling, if i let it. in a couple years ill be able to trust again and maybe fall in love again. But im so tired. Its the second time i fell in love and honestly im worn out.

686,t3_yoi8dz,depression,Mental health in relation to how good your life situation is,"Here is a thought I have been thinking about lately. I used to always think that mental health has a very direct relation with your life situation - if you don't have friends, no job, don't have hobby's, don't have money, don't have a partner, have a poor family situation,.. it is almost inevitable that you develop mental health disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder or depression. However, recently I had a thought that that might not be quite the truth. I think what could be the real problem, leading to mental health disorders, is that it's not such much your problematic life situation per se that causes the problems, nor the fact that you are not making progress or are stuck in certain areas of your life, it's that because you are not making progress or feel stuck your thoughts are going in circles over your life situation or certain areas of your life where you are stuck. I mean that, you don't find anything other in life to focus your thoughts and behaviour on, so that you inevitably come to analyse your own life situation, leading to worry and anxiety/depression. And so it's not per se your life situation quality, or the fact that you are stuck, but rather your focus on being stuck that causes all the trouble. 

For example, if someone with a mental health disorder, takes a long vacation, that in itself could better his mental health not by virtue of improving his life situation, but by effectively providing a means to focus their thoughts and behavior elsewhere. 

As another example, there are people with a decent life situation: good financial situation, kids, good relationships,.. but feel they are not making progress in life in a certain area, and this being stuck becomes a major focus in their life, and starts to absorb all their thinking. It's like a sinkhole for thoughts that would drown anybody.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

692,t3_yoh8sz,depression,"32M, just wish I had a shoulder to cry on.","I am alone.

A lot of people say this, but they still have somebody in their lives.

No wife, no kids. I've had one-night stands periodically, but no serious relationships since I was 18. EIGHTEEN. Back when I was a normal person. My dad and brother died when I was entering adulthood. It splintered my family. I haven't spoken with my mother or sisters since. We didn't get along and my dad was the glue that held us together. He was my best friend and after losing him, I felt like I lost everything. I went from a bubbly, outgoing person, to a total recluse and unwilling to share my life with anyone. I was never close with aunts or uncles, cousins, so they're all out too. No friends; the couple I did have were people not worth taking a bullet for. They'd lied, stolen from me, talked about me behind my back, and weren't there for me when I needed them the most. 

I work in one of the most antisocial work environments I've ever been in. I've been on the job for six months and don't know a soul. I go to school and am working on finishing up two degrees (which is why I'm at the job, it's a weird school schedule), but I'm much older than my peers. As such, they tend to veer away from me and toward people their own age. I don't blame them.

So I don't really know anybody. There is nobody in my life I can think to call when something good or bad happens. And nobody ever calls me. Holidays are spent alone, any adventures I go on are solo.

Anywhere I go, I try to keep a smile on my face and always try to be kind and courteous to others. People ask me how I'm doing and it's always the typical responses, but they don't know I'm actually drowning inside.

I feel like the person in the movies who's standing still in a crowded public place, while time speeds up and people whiz by all around him. I'm just kind of floating through life and have never felt so utterly alone on a planet of almost 8 billion people.

Some days aren't terrible. I'm an introverted person and love my own company. But every once in a while, my primal brain bubbles up and asks where my tribe is. I get hit with an intense sadness and loneliness. But when I try to find a tribe, people can sense something is wrong with me - like I'm broken - no matter how hard I try to smile or be warm. If I do find people that I can somewhat connect with, I always keep them at arm's length. I never let people become true friends and learn about things that are deep and dear within me. I don't like feeling vulnerable.

This has been something I've sucked up for years. It's not a new occurrence. I've worn this predicament on my sleeve like a badge of honor. ""I'm tough, I'm doing this all by myself. Most people couldn't do this,"" I say. But let's be real: most people wouldn't **want** to do this. It's a horrible way to live.

There are so many opportunities I've pissed away into the wind: jobs, women, new friendships, new places to visit. I've kept myself locked away because I'm afraid of being hurt. I think the reality is, I'm already hurt. I'm severely wounded and cannot heal. I'm terrified of people seeing what I'm really going through. I don't want their pity or their sympathy.

But I can't hold all of this together forever. And I can't pretend that as a man, I'm impervious to all of this pain. If there was anything I wish I could have right now, it would be the loving embrace of someone - anyone. I just want someone's shoulder I can sob into. I want someone to hold me and tell me that I'm going to find my way out of this. I don't even know what that's like. Never have felt close enough to anyone where I could just be totally vulnerable with them. And anyone who does have that, know that I am so envious of you.

699,t3_yog3s1,depression,Please. Someone be there.,"It's over. Nearly a year with my gf and now it's over. 

We got into a fight earlier and during the fight while she went out of the room I punched the wall, multiple times. My right had is still recovering from surgery from the first time I punched the wall over a fight. After the fight we made up. I went to the bathroom and noticed how swollen my knuckle was. I went to show her by jokingly saying ""wanna see something gross?"" That instantly triggered her and she went on a walk with her sister. When she came back, she kicked me out.

After two days she finally sent me a note saying she wishes it to be over and that she felt our relationship was toxic. I can see her point. I wasn't the most supportive in her eyes. A jealous boyfriend I am, and she isn't wrong when she says that if I wasn't the one who made her happy, I would ruin her happiness. 

But through my eyes, I just wanted to be her main person. And it felt like I was only that when I specifically asked for it. I just got home from work and the intrusive thoughts I felt the first night have now returned a hundred fold. I would never take .y own life simply because I'm too much of a pussy to do it. But that doesn't stop me from wishing it. 

My relationship prior to this was an even worse toxic relationship on both of our ends. And I fell into depression hard, quitting my job, eating a couple times a week. I don't feel like this break up will send me into the same spiral thanks to going to therapy, but the weight of this depression feels a million times heavier.

Now, I don't just want someone to talk to or for someone to listen to my problems. I need someone.

701,t3_yofsas,depression,The Paregoric Paranoiac,"""...I dont enjoy anything"" he said while enjoying a cigarette.

It was a common complaint from his mouth, but he was unsure if the supposed evidence justified the feeling that drove the words out from
his lips.

""Thats not true, at least, not from what I can tell. You enjoy your cooking, if nothing else. Its like you calling. I'd like to think you enjoy
being around us. You enjoy the cat, and that cigarette.""

They both looked at the smoke, curling up so briefly to its recognizable form before dispersing into the wind

""That's true. But, from my perspective, what good is a fleeting enjoyment if the only thing it seems to add to your continued experience is more
sadness??"" He inquired, flicking at his cigarette emphatically.

The Paranoiac was aware of how selfish he sounded and was. But being aware of this selfishness didn't resolve his pain.

""...This cigarette is good. And, after I have smoked it, it will have been good... I will be both glad that I smoked it, and glad to have the
memory of smoking it. But I wont feel better. I'll feel the same overall, on a visceral level... Yea.""

""But you're telling yourself that!"" The Man interjected, after remaining silent for the early conversation. ""Of course you wont believe in your
enjoyment if you tell yourself you're incapable. Its a self-fulfilling prophecy.""

""Chicken or the egg"" he replied. ""And I am not incapable, its just that every joy costs its weight in misery. Yin-and-yang shit.""

He laughed a bit in earnest, and ventured:

""I guess pearls before swine would be fitting, too: because I feel like the most ungrateful motherfukcer in the world. In my head I am grateful.
Like, when I think about it. But as for how gratitude feels... I'm convinced its the same feeling as sadness. I'm convinced Love, happiness, fear,
anxiety, guilt, comfort... they're all the same feeling as sadness, because they all seem to lead to it eventually.""

The Paranoiac paused. The Two were watching, digesting what he had said with far more concern and empathy than he deserved.        

""...And it doesn't get better. You just get better at dealing; better at hiding it. From yourself and others. But it's there, and no matter
how long you can push it back, how burly your mental arms get, they're still holding all that mysterious weight. It will take its toll.
Makes you crave, no, need a break. Something to tag in, just for a moment, so you can recover your strength enough to go on.""

""But we can tag in. Better than a chemical could!We can take some of the burden"" The Man said with confidence.
He had a comforting look on his face, and the fact that this good natured comfort, bolstered to a level that could work miracles was wasted on HIM,
led our Paranoiac to a pang of sadness...
A pang so deep it didn't register, for it had to stab in amongst the others, festering like needles in his Soul.  

The Paranoiac didn't want to be honest. The truth was cold, but he felt obliged.

...""If that were true, we'd be the same person"" He said.

Both their expressions fell back, though he wasn't sure into what. It wasn't possible to explain the feeling, not in this world, and he
wouldn't want to anyways. To understand is to experience, and sharing his burdens in full (if it were feasible) would thus make him an
evil man.

He shifted out of philosophical context, for if he didnt, he felt as though the world might end.

""And now I'm paranoid, too, you see. I feel as though I can either die from the problem itself, or at the hands of its solution.
I can't be sure which one will kill me quicker, for I assume the timing is different... But both outcomes make me a bit sad, if I'm honest.""

...

""My dope is my choice. It's the only power, among a fair few, that makes me FEEL like I have power against the void, despite its habit of bringing
me closer. But maybe that's not the drug itself, but its subject. Maybe the only thing wrong with drugs is the people who use them.""

...

""So are you going to use tonight?"" Asked The Woman. The Man looked at nothing in disappointment, aware of the answer.

""Don't hold it against me if I do"" said the Paranoiac, in pointless ambiguity.

""I will"" said The Man.

""It wouldn't be right if you didn't"" the Paranoiac half spoke, half thought: the tail end of his conversation with his parents was hard to remember,
except in general, because the only thing on his mind now was how sad this whole situation made him. He'd have to use drugs to avoid the sadness,
and that would also make him sad... What a bother.

Im jus a 19 year old dude in the first semester of my college and im starting to regret my decision. i took a night college course since at day im working from 8 AM to 5PM on Monday to Saturday and then college from 7PM to 10PM on Monday to Friday. I also need to complete additional assignments which usually took around 2-3 hours so i only have around 4-5 hours of sleep everyday, working on a steel mill is already physically exhausting for me and college only makes it worse by being mentally exhausting.

The college itself also sucked. I rarely have offline class and usually it's online. The lecturer are lazy couldn't care less about you, every class is just a prerecorded sessions and then assignments. I basically need to learn,teach and do all of the assignments all by myself and i spend 20 percent of my monthly paycheck for this.

I hate how i can't relax after going home and my daily life is always constant game of going to work-college-finishing assignment before deadline and that's just it i cant even take a break on weekends because there's always another assignment i haven't finished

I wanted to quit college but not my job it might not be the best job in the world but i enjoy it and i get paid for it whereas in college i hate every single session of it and i PAY for it atleast i dont have stupid assignment and deadlines while working. I feel like ill be happier and be less stressful if i could just focus on my job and improving it

But can't tell my parents about it. They'll be very disappointed about my decision and when i first got accepted they're really happy about it.

And to be honest it doesn‚Äôt help that her ex is starting to come back into her life. I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm an AH for that but her ex could not give two shits about me and only acts like she does if she HAS to talk to me. Like filling up tires or whatever.

i guess as an introduction, i'm a 17 year old transmasc with depression/anxiety, probable autism but dx is hard to get, and physical disabilities causing chronic pain and fatigue. (but i can't figure out if that stuff is real or if it's in my head. everyone around me believes it's real but i can't help but feel like a fraud.) i also have c-ptsd and have gone through a lot of trauma during the the relevant window of time. my parents are fantastic, super loving and caring, we are financially comfortable, but we have a lot of disabilities and mental health issues throughout the family so my parents are under a lot of stress pretty much all the time. i've been expected to take care of myself for about 8 years.

i've been struggling to take care of myself ever since i was old enough to be expected to take care of myself, which is also about as long as i've been definitively depressed (i.e, i had already started s//lf h//rming). 

and so somehow i've been getting away with completely not taking care of myself for the past 8 years. i shower maybe once a month. for about 9 months up until a recent suic//de attempt i wore the same outfit (underwear included) every single day and to sleep. i never brush my teeth. i eat nothing but junk, and not much of it because my appetite is barely there. i use marijuana daily to help with my pain and am currently in the process of trying to get a medical card. i have a medication i'm supposed to inject once a week and i maybe i do it once every two weeks, sometimes once a month. i know it's objectively fucking disgusting but i just can't find the motivation to even care let alone change it.

but at the same time as just wanting to give into it and be gross, i also don't want to be a lazy piece of shit and rely on my parents for the rest of my life. i've been lying and somehow keeping it under the radar for the entire time because i'm just so unbelievably embarrassed. i can't admit it at this point. and even if i did, my parents (specifically my mom) are consistently under insane amounts of stress and if i admitted all of this it would put so much more stress on them and my mom has struggled with depression for her whole life and i have this fear that all the stress and bullshit me and my siblings put her through is going to drive her to s//icide even though I know logically that won't happen. i cant bear to put any more stress on them. my two younger siblings already need so much care, one of them has more severe autism than me and one of them is just young, and i'm supposed to be the easy child. i want to be the easy child so so bad. i love the amount of freedom i have, i love being treated like an adult. my parents shouldn't have to coddle and take care of their 17 year old. i'm almost a fucking adult. not to mention how expensive it is to care for two disabled children and one  who's not necessarily disabled but still has special challenges. therapists and everything aren't in-network, i had to take two ambulance rides for my s//icide attempt and i feel so fucking guilty for it.

i can't work right now but i feel like i'm being delusional about that. i tried to have a job recently but i had to quit after just a few weeks when i tried to commit s//icide a few months ago. it was a retail position and it was so painful every day i couldn't deal with it. i hate my life so much but everything about it is ultimately my fault and i just can't find the strength to care. after my s//icide attempt i did a very intensive therapy program where i was asked every day if i was keeping up with self care and hygiene. i said yes every single day. i couldn't bear to admit the truth.

i've been medicated for depression  for three years now and there have been long stretches of time where i would say the medication was working, but i still won't take care of myself, no matter how badly i want to. i'm starting to think this is just an inherent trait of mine and i feel like i'm going to be a disgusting piece of shit for my entire life. my gpa is horrible (2.7 or so, not good enough to get into college) and i can't imagine a career where i am happy. i don't know what to do. i can't dig myself out of this hole of dirt and lies and fucking suffering and honestly i wish i was dead.

I stayed with a relative in the city where the exam was held. Things didn't go well. I failed. Currently, my family is working to send me money. This is killing me. I've never had a girlfriend. I don't have any friends. I have to work to stand on my own feet. No problem. I work. But there is no job. I've been looking for a while and can't find any jobs. 

   I like to draw. Listen to music. The theatre. I love art in many ways. But the life I'm in right now pushes me out of it. Which is okay, I can push myself for a while. But there is no exit. Have you watched The Perks of Being a Wallflower? I don't want much, just a few good people, good music, and a livable life. There is no way out where life pushes me. It's getting worse day by day. I can't find a job, I can't be interested in art, I can't make friends and I can't breathe anymore. It's like something inside of me is dying over time. Maybe if my country's economy wasn't so bad... Maybe something could have happened. Maybe things would be better if I got cancer, if only for a while. Anxiety about the future can be over. People can treat me better. The people behind me may never know that I am unhappy. I do not know. ""Maybes"" hurt me a lot. I've been hesitant to write this for a while because every time I come in here I see people with bigger problems. They still exist. But the longer I wait, the more the pain grows.

   I think the time I was bullied had consequences that made me fear judgment and humiliation for my suffering. Thank you for your time. And for trying to feel me. It's nice to think that one day when my feelings die, there will be someone out there who feels for me. Take care of yourself. Sorry for my bad English too.

717,t3_yoe9h3,depression,Uh," I wrote this in the middle of wanting to kms, I guess take this.

I just don't get the point of living my pathetic painful life just to end up dead with nobody remembering me. The fact that millions of people die every year and most of them probably go unnoticed. Unless you're famous then millions of people miss you while also wishing you were dead all along. If I died in my sleep it would take 17 hours minimum for anyone to even notice, only 3 people I know would actually cry and miss me, and after that, I would be forgotten forever. Nobody in the entire 7 billion people in the world would have to know how I'm feeling right now and how I have felt my whole life. It's always ‚Äúkeep going :)‚Äù but without reason. And then the only thing I have on my list of reasons is my cats and once they die there's nothing. Speaking of cats, I would prefer to live with them in whatever ""afterlife"" is real. Why would anyone on this planet choose to continue life when it's so shit? There's no place on earth that isn't having a crisis, there's so many extinct animals because of humans, there's so many starving people on the streets, there's trash in almost all wildlife, and we cant even give people basic rights. This world is falling apart and people are still forced to go to school, go to work, get up out of bed. If this is what it's come to I'm surprised the su1c1\*e rates are higher. ""Just deal with it"". Why would anyone be expected to deal with this? Oh I know, because the people who are supposed to deal with it are out in yachts drinking Chardonnay knowing that because they have money they can do whatever they want. If little kids are making more change in this world than adults, that's worrying. Especially when mental health for newer generations are dropping. Depression cases are higher than ever, and the pandemic was never helping, and su1c1\*e rates are rising too. How are some people going to tell kids that picking up a single piece of trash or planting a single tree will help the earth? Because unless you were to get paid for doing these basic things nobody will do it. The people who do try and save the earth, unfortunately, aren't rich enough, and they will never be heard. Why would anyone want to try and save the earth when it's a lost cause? Let's even get started on school, because it's one of the causes that almost all people with mental illness would point to as a factor. School is unfair and unreasonable. Imagine if we told an alien species that we force children from ages 5-16 to devote almost their entire life to this school. Wake up early, stay at the school for 6-10 hours, while at school you have to participate in every class, follow every single stupid rule, listen and understand the multiple(over 7) unnecessary subjects, punish them when they don't listen to the teachers, ridicule them for not understanding, even control when they eat or use the bathroom. Now this is bad, but take the average 13 hours of not being at school out of a day. Subtract 8 for time sleeping and we already have 5 hours to do what we want. Now we subtract the time of doing homework most teachers give, for about an hour, so 4 hours. Now subtract 30 minutes for eating, 3.5 hours. Now subtract another 30 minutes for getting to and from school, 3 hours. Now we have to clean, shower, brush our teeth, do chores, that's already down to 2 maybe 1.5 hours left to do what we actually want to do. And then, (this us the best part) If you DON'T go to this hell, you or your parents get arrested. Again, for not going to this place that most people hate, you get put in JAIL. Now most people wouldn't want that, so, just don't try at school, right? Most people can just grow to take the ridicule and don't care about grades and behavior. Well that wouldn't work either because the punishment for that, oddly enough, is having to take the exact same classes with the same teachers AGAIN putting you behind other students. Don't want to do that either? Well you have to go to summer school. ""What's summer school?"" The poor aliens would ask. In our school system, you get a summer break between school years that lasts all of summer. If you fail the class, you have to take, well, summer school. Basically they take away your only break and force you to go to school during summertime. And guess what? If you fail summer school you have to make up for it by staying in school longer. The alien species would think that were insane. They would think that our society is doomed. Which it is. ""Just get therapy, you sound like you need it"" Why? Why would you pay money to be lied to and feel slightly better? But what about the millions in poverty who actually need it and can't pay for the help and assistance? Too bad. That's what this society has led to. 

Too, fucking, bad.

726,t3_yodqrf,depression,The feeling of exhausting every conceivable avenue for happiness...,"Hi Redditors,

I just wanted to vent a bit about my life--if anyone wants to respond I'd really appreciate it but you don't have to. I understand this is a lot of text.

I graduated from a fairly prestigious college back in May. The entirety of senior year I was dreading graduating for various reasons. No job lined up, no real relationships under my belt, very little sex, and overall a disappointing college experience compared to what I hoped for in high school. The one good thing to come out of it was I unexpectedly became a very good drummer, although I don't have the experience or connections to become a pro. I'm fairly confident that I could become a pro musician with a bit of the right help, whether that be joining the right band, going to the right jam session, learning a few more secrets, etc. But as it stands, I'm basically a hobby drummer that spends too much time practicing for no rational reason.

I didn't graduate with a job lined up, but I landed something not-great shortly after graduation. It pays a bit less than the average for my college's graduates and it's not prestigious. The low salary pretty much requires me to live with my parents. Still, I was hopeful going into it--I naively figured work of any kind would bring me some kind of fulfillment, especially compared to doing nothing I did from June-August. I was wrong--this job is incredibly boring because it's essentially doing the same exact process over and over throughout the day. It's remote so I spend pretty much the entire day in my bedroom. But the worst part is my coworkers. I've come to realize they aren't very intelligent. I'm vastly outperforming them and my mangers recognize and reward that, but it's not enough to bring much feeling of actualization. I'm studying for the CFA exam but I honestly can't see myself getting a better job. I've just been rejected so many times it seems like insanity to hope for something like that. In my last interview for another job I supposedly came close but lost out due to lack of experience.

Today, I asked out a girl I used to talk to and flirt with in college because I'm supposed to go back there next weekend. It was a bit of a longshot but it seemed like she liked me, and we've been talking almost every day for the past week. She said she was busy the nights I'll be there. That rejection wouldn't set me off like this on its own, it's just that my last date was well over a year ago, and it killed me when the girl didn't want a second one. I then fell for another girl with a boyfriend who was leading me on. I had talked to her about her behavior crossing into relationship territory, and she kept doing those same things going forward, simultaneously making me fall completely in love with her while feeling guilty about my intentions in hanging out with her. I did the right thing in pulling away but I've felt like shit pretty much ever since then. The days I would spend with her were honestly some of the happiest of my life. Overall, she is an utterly beautiful person, inside and out. She made me feel like a man, more confident and with a sense of purpose. We were close to the point where I felt like I was in a relationship with her even though there were no explicitly romantic acts. I didn't know the girl I asked out tonight as well, but I really thought this could've been the start of something. I don't know what her true reasons are for being ""busy"" but the end result isn't good for me in any case.

Maybe my expectations are too elevated, but that's the only thing that has kept me going throughout my recent life. But still, I find myself disappointed in my career and relationships about 99% of the time. Every swing is a miss. I can buy a better bat and lessons but sometimes it just seems like baseball (life) isn't for me. Having had such a disappointing college experience with little to show for it makes me question what the point of trying for anything is. I hate where I am, and I can't get ahead. I'm on the dating apps and the farthest I've gotten is a facetime--afterwards, she then ghosted me shortly before our planned date.

Anyway, the gist of the story is that I've exhausted every avenue I know of for achieving some kind of happiness. I've had therapy in the past, and while it helped, I don't think that will be a lasting solution. To move forward, I'll need to make some kind of radical life change because opportunities are not coming my way.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

I have ""ADHD"" but my honest guess is that I'm living with the consequences of two significant childhood brain injuries.  But I'll never know because I can't get an MRI due to the fact that there's metal in my heart and an MRI involves a giant magnet.

I can't stop watching porn

I can't stop masturbating

I can't drive properly no matter who teaches me and how many times I do 'lessons'.

Learning anything is impossible since I can barely retain any information.

I've never been happy.  I'm so sad all the time.  Medication I take for ADHD helps but whenever I sit down and reflect I'm reminded of how inadequate I am compared to nearly everyone else.

I hate drinking even though I do it every chance I get.  I've blown up so much of my life and lost so many people due to things I've done and said while intoxicated.  Yet I keep doing them.

I have nobody to talk to who understands.  I have a therapist but I feel like I'm wasting her time since I can't retain anything she says to me.  In one ear, out the other.

I don't have suicidal thoughts but I have fantasies of leaving where I currently am, except for the fact that I know I can't outrun things and would just end up this miserable no matter where I leave to.

I am tired.  So damn tired.  Time has gone by so fast and I've done nothing with it.  I've wasted every opportunity I've ever been given.  I've pushed away anybody who ever loved me (besides immediate family) and I just can't figure out how to do things right.

I hate myself.  I hate my life.  I hate how I've wasted 99% of every second I've been alive.  I feel like I owe everyone I've ever known a massive apology for burdening them with my existence.

753,t3_yobh5r,depression,"I just want validation, and I know I'm shit for thinking this.","I don't know what to say. If I'm being honest, truthfully, brutally honest, I wish I went through with my suicide attempt. I know that's something I guess people who are trying to get their life in order would say, but I don't know. There have been so many times I've wanted to do something, almost did, then backed out.

I'm such a fucking chicken I couldn't even go through with killing myself. And because of that, I don't feel valid. Because I'm surrounded by people who objectively have it worse than me, I can't complain about my problems. I've never been physically abused or sexually abused besides some sexual harassment. I don't think I've been mentally or verbally abused though that may be a gray area. Sure, I used to cut myself, but I don't anymore.

Sure, I could have killed myself, but I didn't. So shouldn't I be proud of myself for having the strength, unlike others? I really don't feel proud of myself which is a shit thing to say. But because I've been dubbed ""lucky"" by lots of people, I don't feel like I'm allowed to have problems. And because I technically didn't have a failed suicide attempt, I feel greatly invalid when it comes to suicide.

Trust me, I want to get better and all, but it's like not being to do all those things I was about to do is stopping me. Whether it be good or bad, I've been invalided my whole life by others and myself. How am I supposed to talk to others about my problems who've tried several times to kill themselves while I couldn't even try once? It's so fucking stupid, but I feel so fucking invalid.

I don't even know why I stopped, to be honest. I think it might have been because my ex drained me so much I just didn't have the energy. Calling the cops that night was a mistake. Even if I went through with it or not, calling the cops was not a good decision. And if I could go back to that night, I would have done it.

And that's where things get weird. I want to get so close to an experience but not complete it. Yes, I had the goal in mind to die that night, but the more I think about it. And the more I spend time with my girlfriend, it's more of: I wish I did it but lived just so I could feel validated in how I feel now. Even friends at school who blatantly said they've tried to kill themselves. It's so fucking invalidating honestly, but I can't say anything of that because it's fucked up to wish you did attempt suicide just to live.

I don't know if this will ever resolve. And while it makes me want to just try it, just one more time, but to see the next day, I know I can't. I already put my friends through enough, and my girlfriend has enough going on already. I couldn't ever leave knowing the amount of pain I'd leave. That doesn't stop me from every now and then wishing I did it.

And maybe that's why I let people rant to me. Or why I beg my friends and girlfriend to vent even if I know it'll trigger me. If I can't have the validation the way it was originally going to be then I'll find another way. And that way is being the therapist friend I guess. It's horrible, and some days I go over through all the things I've seen and feel god awful about it all. It both invalidates and validates me at the same time.

I know I should be happy, and that I'm luckier than others. I shouldn't be losing motivation if I have no reason to lose it. But hearing those people's trauma and the emotional toll it takes on me. Well, I guess that's my own way of self-harm. At least then, I can feel validated if I feel down. If I can get to a traumatic situation before others, especially my friends or my girlfriend, and stop it before they can see it then good. Even if it's fresh cuts or a pedophile, as long as others don't get traumatized by it, I'm fine with taking the hit.

Even if it's not real trauma or outright dumb, which it is, at least I can feel validated in some way. It's certainly not healthy, and I know that, but that's the only way I really know how. I'll be the test dummy for others to trauma dump on if it means my friends don't have to. And if others can feel better at the expense of my mental well-being then so be it.

I really wish I had gone through with it and lived. I've had that thought so many times, just so scared to die. And when I went to do it, I was ready somewhat. But my ex just had to fuck it up. I want to feel valid, and surviving a suicide attempt was my plan for it. Don't get me wrong, I didn't almost try for attention. I really did want to die, but the idea of getting better was I don't know. Regardless, it's stupid, and I'm stupid for ever thinking these thoughts.

I just want to feel valid, and I find that I feel valid through trauma. I'm sorry to everyone who reads this, especially my girlfriend. I don't want them to worry, and I truly am getting somewhat better. Just, it's not like I want to die anymore, I just want to feel valid. That's all.",1.0,2.0,0.0,2.0

756,t3_yobaxy,depression,About twenty and about to commit suicide,"4 months ago the love of my life ended with me after 3 years of relationship. It was my first relationship and they were the best years of my life. I feel completely empty without it and, after trying everything for 4 months, I can't get better.

She left me saying that she ""didn't know what she wanted,"" so I understand that she didn't love me and that's why she left me. Anyway, now she likes someone else, I found out spying on her Twitter account (I'm not proud of that) and I just can't live without her. Thinking that he doesn't need me, that he doesn't love me, he doesn't even like me, it hurts me too much, it takes away all the desire to live. I'm in love with her and I can't stop thinking about her beautiful face.

Her birthday is December 5th and mine is December 10th, I plan to survive until her birthday to tell her ""Happy Birthday"", send her a gift (Probably a craft with a message from when we were dating made with my own hands and a bouquet of sunflowers [I used to call she Sunflower]) accompanied by a letter telling her how much I love her and that she is the love of my life and those cheesy things but that I really feel and, a couple of days later, tell her that I'm going to commit suicide minutes before doing it. You know, as a last goodbye to the person I love.

I don't want her to be sad if I die, maybe she'll be destroyed or maybe she'll just be surprised for a while and then go on with her life (I'm not going to lie, I'd like her to cry when she finds out that I'm dying) but I just want to end all the suffering caused by not being with her.

I can't stop thinking about how warm his hugs were, you know? Before I die I would love to have even one more, that's why I'm going to try to get closer to her before her birthday, try to fix things (she blocked me because we tried to be friends but I wasn't ready and I tried to be with her again), so I don't die full of remorse.

Anyway, what do you think? Doubts? Comments? Let me know.

758,t3_yob3ud,depression,I'm having a hard time lately,"So recently one of my dear friends passed away. She was in her forties and still had her entire life to live. One day she didn't show up to her job. The next day she didn't show up either. They sent someone to her house to do a welfare check and that's how they found her. The coroner's report still hasn't come back yet but it was a suspected heart attack. She was a wonderful person and anyone that knew her was blessed. &lt;&gt;  Not only this but recently my daughter moved out. We were always extremely close until she moved out. She doesn't even call me. My text to her go ignored.  I am not the type of mom to constantly call text try to get ahold of her I tried to give her her space Because this is what she needs right now. They say when they are young they step on your toes and when they are older they step all over your heart. I have found this to be extremely true. &lt;&gt;  I am an amputee with 2 failed prosthetics. Because of this I have to use a mobility scooter to get around.  Well my scooter is breaking down. Without this scooter I will be bed ridden. For a person like me that is a nightmare. I have to be up and about able to do things.
&lt;&gt;The other day I fell and I banged myself up pretty bad. I have bruises all over my arms and my face and my jaw and my legs.  My neck and shoulders hurt so bad I think I gave myself whiplash.  If my son hadn't have been home I would not have been able to have gotten up. Most days I am home alone. I have a caregiver but She doesn't come in half the time. I don't complain about her to her bosses because I don't want her to get into trouble. &lt;&gt;  Usually I can handle my depression and anxiety but lately it is really gotta hold on me. Dark thoughts are constantly creeping into my mind lately. Like what's the point of being here. What is my purpose here. What's the point anymore. Then the usual thoughts will come into my mind like my family would be better off without me. It would probably be a relief to everyone if I were gone. Plus if I were gone my family would get insurance money which would help them out greatly. &lt;&gt;

I‚Äôm a 25 year old gay guy. I‚Äôm just a big piece of shit. Ive always struggled to help my mom with the kitchen and chores‚Ä¶or being a normal functioning adult,¬† the kitchen and dining room area is full of windows and the curtains are very transparent and my paranoia while being in front of a window and feeling watched by my neighbors is too much. I‚Äôm a terrible son. I also struggle to go to the gym or park to workout cause I‚Äôm just too¬† socially anxious and my inferiority complex and constant comparison wears me down and I start crying loud in my car in the parking lot cause I can‚Äôt focus on the workout. I also struggle to cook my own food cause I‚Äôm paranoid of my kitchens windows and also¬† in my mind I‚Äôm like ‚Äúmy cousin might cook it better than me, my sisters do it better, omg there are windows everywhere someone might be watching your pathetic existence ‚Äù every demon from my past appears and I start to feel weak, shaky, and I get so anxious I start stumbling around and doing things fast just so I can run back to my room and disappear, everything I do I do it in an anxious manner and there are times I drop and break things, while my neighbors on my kitchens windows might be witnessing every disappointment after disappointment . I can hear them laughing and saying things like ‚Äúwho is that crazy one‚Äù. At work I can‚Äôt do anything other than pretending to work cause every time I run into a big obstacle I just get paralyzed and stuck and if I ask for help I have trouble speaking¬† and run out of breath and my thoughts start to race and then I confuse people and i don‚Äôt even know how to explain my issue and i feel out of breath and I just get even more stuck than I was before‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm surprised i haven‚Äôt been fired. It‚Äôs been like this for the last 3 years. I‚Äôm a terrible worker, I‚Äôm a business intelligence analyst and Everytime I‚Äôm asked to create a report or extract information from a data base using coding (sql) I always bump into a problem I don‚Äôt even understand and can‚Äôt explain to myself, so I just get creative and try a bunch of things until I see a result (never happens) and I could easily spend months trying to complete a task requirement that seems so simple in the surface‚Ä¶ clients have gotten exhausted with me and I struggle to handle it, even the tiniest criticism from my coworker throws me off‚Ä¶ shit‚Äôs about to hit the fan soon. I‚Äôm too emotional for the corporate world, I‚Äôve never delivered a requirement to the senior director of my department and every coworker has had and they have had some kind of interaction with her I get too anxious beside her‚Ä¶at my job i end up burning out and let everything else pile up‚Ä¶ I think¬† my manager and coworker¬† have noticed my incompetence and I can see the contempt and disappointment in their eyes but they never say it upfront. I‚Äôm useless im too dumb for this job.¬† I don‚Äôt manage the money I earn well because I feel guilty cause I don‚Äôt deserve it, for being such a terrible worker. I feel like the money is stolen.

I never learned anything at college I just memorized information and forgot about it after every test‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how I got my 3.9 gpa. I thought I was doing the right thing. turns out I wasn‚Äôt.¬† ¬† My prospects in the job market are low right now cause I have nothing to show so trying to look for a better job seems impossible and I‚Äôll get terrible reviews from my past employer and it will take a bunch of time to get my work history fixed but I‚Äôm too anxious to deal with that anyway. Even going to the shopping mall or grocery store is a nightmare and everything feels awful i feel so ashamed of my existence and i CAN‚ÄôT mute the constant comparisons and the inferiority dialogue in my mind.. I‚Äôm terrified of running into someone from school university family or work, I look terrible,¬† I look done and lost, I struggle to keep my room organized cause every time I do a chore my mind gets too clouded with negative thoughts and I start comparing to other people and i feel discouraged and I feel too depleted to even do anything. I also feel like things are never clean or organized enough. ‚ÄúThere must be a better and less stressful way‚Äù. Everything destroys me emotionally. I‚Äôve never been happy I‚Äôm just a living burden leeching off people I‚Äôm an emotional vampire I‚Äôm too scared to live, no friends cause I feel inferior to everyone and I‚Äôm also too scared about rejection or even being joked at or teased. During casual conversations, Some people at work are very condescending towards me cause they see me like a shy kid who hasn‚Äôt experienced life yet they are surprised I‚Äôm 25. Even the younger ones think I‚Äôm younger than them. I‚Äôm gay and I‚Äôm anxious about it too and I feel so inferior to other men, I don‚Äôt feel man enough I can‚Äôt bond with other men they all have hobbies that I don‚Äôt share and when you don‚Äôt have common hobbies¬† or life experiences you can‚Äôt have friends.. cause what are am I gonna say? Just ask questions? At some point I‚Äôm gonna be asked a personal question and I won‚Äôt know what to say. I‚Äôve been such a disappointment for 11 crucial years and that burden I don‚Äôt wanna carry it for the rest of my life, feeling guilty for all the trouble I‚Äôve caused, my mom thinks im a retarded weirdo no social life and was always concerned about the other kids calling me crazy and weird, nothing interest me anymore, I have no hobbies, nothing I‚Äôm actually interested in, living seems too scary to leave my bed, being a walking disappointment and feeling inferior to better people is something I don‚Äôt wanna keep dealing and coping with. My mom has had to force me to buy myself a car,¬† cause I didn‚Äôt know how to do it myself and I kept delaying it for YEARS, my mom has had to pressure me to start investing but I was so hesitant and anxious to do it and it stayed rotting for almost 3 years in a low interest saving account‚Ä¶ I just bought a new phone and I have this ‚Äúminor‚Äù issue trying to transfer my WhatsApp messages from my old phone to my new one and I feel like I can‚Äôt even solve this simple problem and my mom asks me why I have a lot of issue dealing with the smallest problems in life‚Ä¶. my mom has also pressured me into buying clothes cause everything I have is wearing out but i get choice paralysis and social anxiety when I go to the store and always pick random things I end up hating or just leave home with nothing in my hands cause I can‚Äôt stop the anxiety and I hate trying things while looking myself in the mirror it seems like nothing looks good on me and also I can‚Äôt stop comparing myself to strangers who appear to be more attractive and more confident and I end up rushing back home feeling depressed and crying. It took me a week to buy a BELT cause my previous one was in terrible condition. I went to the store, bought a belt quickly then came back and then my mom saw I picked a brown color that was too strong it almost looked red and she demanded me to return it and find a less bright shade cause I would be dress coded if I don‚Äôt do it. Then I returned a second time to the store and picked the wrong one again and then I had to return a third time. All thanks to my stupid anxious self. My mind is always trying to read people‚Äôs minds, scan the place, it‚Äôs like it grabs the energy of every person around me and creates a cocktail‚Ä¶ and I start to feel everything‚Ä¶ and I start to feel paranoid‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs horrible. my mind gets clouded with questions like ‚Äúwhat if that person is mocking me from behind?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I get sexualized?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat does that facial expression mean?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo I have something in my face?‚Äù i can feel how stiff my body gets, its like my body tries to fold into a fetal position even when I‚Äôm standing my butt sticks in, my legs start to bend, my shoulders feel heavy , my neck leans forward, I start to look like a turtle, it‚Äôs like the upper body and lower body are trying to fold against each other to protect the core (the stomach)‚Ä¶. The worst part is: I‚Äôm aware that my body looks extremely weird and I struggle to do anything about it. It‚Äôs humiliating. Now as I write this I understand why people had so much to say about my posture at school and I felt so powerless cause it was hard for me to correct it, it was more than just a lazy posture, it was a defense mechanism, it is my body reacting to every trigger around me. I feel like I‚Äôm shrinking. Same thing happens when I‚Äôm sitting around other people. Eating in public or around others is like so horrible to me. For that same reason I haven‚Äôt experienced a lot of things in life, foods, restaurants, drinks, sports, sex, different landscapes, love, friendships, fashion styles. Even tho¬† I admit some days I feel better than others, the pain remains.¬† I tried meds but I hated feeling numb and sleepy all the time I even had a suicidal attempt while I was on meds so I don‚Äôt think it makes things better for me, cause as long as I‚Äôm sober I have a little more control over myself and I‚Äôm more alert to my actions and I‚Äôm scared of myself when I lower my inhibitions cause anything could happen. I‚Äôve had intrusive dark thoughts so I‚Äôm in a constant state of alertness. I cant trust myself. I have to be hyper aware of my every move. It‚Äôs very draining it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm holding onto a bunch of things at the same time‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why I burn out so easily and get paralyzed and unproductive. I struggle to live and I don‚Äôt care about my life anymore, what‚Äôs the point when everyone around me is getting married building families¬† and a project for their lives knowing what they want and they have a plan, and i feel like i will always struggle to build that kind of life and always feel like judged for being gay and just feel wrong, I know I don‚Äôt wanna live and I‚Äôm just unconsciously sabotaging my independence and my future cause if I live I‚Äôll have to swallow and accept my reality, struggle every day, accept my inferior position in comparison to most of my peers who didn‚Äôt waste years, my past, my wasted years, lack of life experience, pretend everything is okay just to look mature, accepting that I‚Äôll have to work a 9 to 5 and then die, risk everything on something that might likely not work, I‚Äôll have to deal with my mind that burns out with the simplest tasks and challenges, I‚Äôll have to accept homophobia as bread and butter, I‚Äôll have to pretend i don‚Äôt care about others opinions, I‚Äôll have to pretend nothing triggers me, I wish I wasn‚Äôt born. I really REALLY wanna die. I think the only option I have to get out of the 9 to 5 job, not deal with people, work remotely with flexible hours (not 8 hours straight), live in a better country and having decent pay to afford a nice comfortable spacious place to live and to travel the world is by studying something extremely depressing and stressful like coding or web dev and then trying to apply for jobs abroad (if I ever get one)‚Ä¶¬† I‚Äôm not meant to be alive. I don‚Äôt even enjoy eating, wearing nice clothes, hanging out, or doing basic human activities that are not even related to work‚Ä¶ there is no point, I feel disconnected from everyone and everything is so sad, anxious, triggering and gray . Even the sunlight depresses me. Everything is so pointless. And I can‚Äôt give life a meaning cause I‚Äôm always triggered by everything‚Ä¶ I feel so anxious and like I‚Äôm being stabbed every single day. Im reminded of my past, I struggle to approach people who I found very inspiring and joyful and whom I would like to be friends with when I‚Äôm in front of them I feel¬† so guilty for the burden I‚Äôve been for being uncontrollably obsessed with gay porn, for being childish, terrible worker, pushing people away and avoiding interaction, being emotionally immature, getting distracted easily, and struggling to ignore my thoughts and my ego. I‚Äôm worthless. I don‚Äôt deserve good friends I‚Äôll always be someone‚Äôs problem‚Ä¶ As a gay man I don‚Äôt even see a future when it comes to family, and I‚Äôll always envy those who will build families without dealing with judgment over their genders, orientation and being married¬† . I fucked up. I can‚Äôt even take care of myself‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never liked a haircut on me and I would always break down trying to style my hair‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm here crying on the floor of my bathroom as I write this. Why am I still doing this? I knew when I was 17 that life would be too big for me, I told myself that right after high school I¬† was going to kill myself, but I kept delaying it and delaying it for years and life has only gotten worse for me. I‚Äôm pathetic.¬† I was right. I should‚Äôve ended my life back then. Im terrible at everything I do. My highschool and college years were terrible, no friends, socially anxious, loser, isolated, addicted to porn to deal with my loneliness and anxiety. And now at work I‚Äôm still the same, and I feel like such a pathetic piece of worthless existence. I‚Äôm a walking disappointment. The only successful thing I ever did in my life was graduating with a 3.9 gpa in business degree. I forgot about every concept I ‚Äúlearned ‚Äù cause I just was memorizing stuff in a very hardcore way (I would find myself sitting on the toilet with my laptop while memorizing stuff and skipping meals cause I couldn‚Äôt even take a break to pee or shower until I had memorized everything) I thought having a 3.9 gpa would be enough for me to get in a plane and never come back to this country. Only to realize no one cares about it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm from a third world country and who cares about a degree from a third world country anyway‚Ä¶ I desperately wanted to leave to Spain or Canada or USA but i can‚Äôt make a plan I get too overwhelmed over the amount of information out there and I‚Äôm drowned in self doubt If I do leave somewhere I see myself living with strangers forever and never having my own place and I feel like i won‚Äôt be able to make friends and I‚Äôll be lonely and I‚Äôll struggle to have fun activities cause I struggle to trust people I just want wholesome trustworthy people around me. Every time I see someone smoking, wearing revealing tight clothes, talking about sex, excessive teasing and banter, gossiping, drinking, full of tattoos I feel like I CAN‚ÄôT be around that person because they seem dangerous to me and I feel threatened‚Ä¶ (don‚Äôt mean to offend anyone it‚Äôs just how I feel it‚Äôs not you its me and my extreme trust isssues) nightclubs and bars are so scary, even the beach can feel scary too, it‚Äôs like there is no fun place out there for me, I feel socially retarded. Im scared people will notice my awkwardness cause It has been pointed out multiple times in my life, I‚Äôm scared they‚Äôll notice the way I walk and my posture which is heavily influenced by my anxiety and sometimes it‚Äôs too hard to maintain a good posture cause my body starts shaking and I feel stiff‚Ä¶. As I mentioned before. I hate my job. I don‚Äôt even like corporate shit i used to spend hours on my pc making silly videos instead of hanging out during highschool¬† until I got depressed and bored but ugh that seems so pathetic nowadays. I just played it safe cause I didn‚Äôt want to end up poor, I picked a business administration degree but gosh I‚Äôm miserable working at a bank, the worst part is dressing up on my worn out clothes that my mom bought for me years ago, feeling tired of trying to look ok cause it‚Äôs never enough and I feel out of place, I hate glueing and destroying my already damaged hair with hairstyling products just to appear formal at work, everyday I have to face body and gender dysmorphia when I look into the mirror, i wanna puke when I see myself in a public bathroom (one of the main reasons I stopped going to the gym was because of the damn mirrors everywhere and having to look at myself and getting triggered by my own reflection and I also hate working out alone in my room I just feel like I‚Äôm never doing enough and the demons get louder and I get depressed and there are distractions everywhere that I struggle to ignore) i CAN‚ÄôT see myself as a man,¬† my proportions are weird my face is too childish my voice is too feminine‚Ä¶ i cringe and my gut gets stiff as I listen to my voice knowing there are younger men at my job who sound like a man who act more calm and composed while I get mistaken for a girl everytime I‚Äôm on the phone but I hate pretending to make my voice sound deeper cause I cringe‚Ä¶ i feeel disgusting in my skin. My muscles might be too atrophied now to even get bigger , I am dragging guilt everywhere I go I feel like a piece of shit and apologize to people for being in their presence, I feel like a living doodle. If that makes sense. On weekends I spend most of my days on my bed, masturbating and feeling exhausted. i feel stuck in this country. I feel stuck in this life. And the worst part is the amount of years it will take for me to rewire my destroyed brain to try and fit in and become a functional member of society for once. Can‚Äôt deal with the¬† pain I‚Äôll have to endure as I try to ignore or not get thrown off by these mental burdens, deep rooted core limiting beliefs and compulsive urges I‚Äôve been carrying for my entire life. The uncertainty and pain that comes with accepting my miserable existence and letting every year of my remaining youth be dedicated to reopening wounds so that they could be able to heal in an uncertain future makes me even more anxious. I tried healing, going to therapy and meds already but all it created was a lot of resistence. 5 years of nothing. My inner demons are so robust and strong‚Ä¶ Im exhausted of the constant fight. Everytime i stare at myself into the mirror I see a lonely piece of shit. All I see is: my rested bitch face, a person who has never built rapport with a human being, never built¬† true connection, terrible son, brother, Malnourished, scared of being seen, envious, inferior. tired of living, too scared to voice their opinions or demand what he wants, puny, scrawny, scared, anxious, dysmorphic, terrible skin, needy, alone, I‚Äôm a walking sigh if that makes sense, unprofessional, wasted teenage years, wasted early 20s, no social life, terrible face,¬† virgin, stretch marks, scars, suicidal attempts, crazy manic person, compulsive thoughts, porn addicted, my sisters are married one of them is living in New York with her husband who earns 120k a year, my other sister is living with a guy who earns 5k a month in my third world country and his company pays for his vacations and trips and retreats and they‚Äôve traveled to a lot of countries together im happy for them but I just feel so behind stuck in a job where all I do is copy and paste graphs in excel cause my mind is too dumb and impatient to automate daily reports using programming language and I feel so useless and stupid I hate this shit, my sister has a perfect resume and I feel like mine is so confusing with irrelevant stuff, she and my brother-in-law both won a scholarship to do a masters degree in the USA and I tried to win it as well but I lost and feel like a failure and I can‚Äôt afford a masters degree¬† let alone an international degree from a prestigious country like USA I feel like it will make things harder for me and now I‚Äôm just so behind, I‚Äôm a virgin, craving sex and affection, the single sibling, fatherless boy, the¬† single cousin, thick black hair everywhere, CAN‚ÄôT communicate like a normal fucking person. Extremely socially anxious and shy‚Ä¶ feeling like a loser, Never know what to say when I‚Äôm supposed to talk. 12k in debt, only 10k saved up. Receding hairline,¬† balding, my hair is growing horizontally if that makes sense, my hairy wrinkly small ass is disgusting and full of really dark spots and stretchmarksüì∑  Sorry for traumatizing you, never gonna let it be seen, how could I¬† even imagine myself with one of my crushes who always happen to be extremely attractive who have a lot going on in comparison to me, when I see my eyes I can see the regret of never approaching and expressing my true feelings to those guys I liked even if I didn‚Äôt know they were gay cause I‚Äôm so scared of rejection humiliation and maybe getting beaten up , I‚Äôm not as strong as those openly gay men, I‚Äôm tired of my life. Everytime I enter a room I feel like I‚Äôm shrinking.¬† Everyone seems more emotionally mature and not anxious at all, The shame of looking so skinny crazy ugly¬† depressed lost disheveled and tired is¬† too much and I‚Äôm scared of getting called out for my ugliness‚Ä¶ cause I wouldn‚Äôt know what to say‚Ä¶. Fool of me for thinking that I would manage to get to a better country or have a nice apartment and get a partner and travel the world together while doing something I love¬† before turning 30. I just realized I‚Äôll never get there cause I will have to face my shit and uncertainty and rely on hope and I‚Äôm too tired for that. In less than 5 years I‚Äôll be 30 and I can see myself comparing and feeling inferior even then, and I‚Äôm still the same worthless piece of shit I ever was and I am too regretful to just forgive and forget my shitty history of being a shitty gloomy person always avoiding people, always scaring people away with my awkwardness‚Ä¶ with nothing to show professionally or personally. I just hate myself so much, everything is too heavy for me‚Ä¶ and I get easily triggered and distracted. I‚Äôm lost and truly I think I‚Äôm just about to give up. I can‚Äôt take responsibility for my own life everything seems uncertain and hopeless . Is either ending up homeless sleeping on the dirty dangerous streets or just dying. Everytime I try to get my life together I get too overwhelmed and I can‚Äôt focus on anything cause every area of my life is burning and bleeding out. why am I alive I want to be crushed by a giant building or a train I wanna die quick and painlessly I want to turn into a pool of blood and I want my worthless body parts destroyed within seconds. I‚Äôm such a waste of space I burn out easily. Too emotional, too sensitive. I‚Äôve tried to swallow tears everyday at work sometimes my eyes get too watery and I just try to hide myself.¬† Life is not for weak people like me. I just need to leave space for those who can adapt to life and can overcome their fears. My past is stained with lack of life experience and I‚Äôll always have to remember that. The expectations are different now, I can‚Äôt revive my teenage years or childhood or early 20s. I‚Äôm too old for that. But I still hear the echoes of my past, my mom comparing me to other guys like my male cousin even knowing¬† that he clearly had better living conditions than me and a father figure, blaming me for my father leaving us, making me feel horrible comparing me to sociopaths on movies like the Kevin from ‚Äúwe need to talk about Kevin‚Äù and when she saw Joker she told me ‚ÄúI saw this movie, it‚Äôs so sad, I just want you to know that we love you so much‚Äù like how am I supposed to feel when my own mother sees me as a social threat, blaming me for quitting every job she has been in, I can still hear my sister saying she would prefer to have my manly male cousin as her brother instead of me, that teacher who asked everyone in my class if they agreed that I was weird too feminine and needed to act like other boys and they all agreed, everybody moved on and I‚Äôm stuck in the past with all of these wounds and I feel so doomed, i obsess about that male cousin whom I was compared to and I just see how independent stronger and disciplined he is and now he is living in a better country he is engaged to his future wife and got a work visa¬† after finishing his international master degree, he is just one year older than me, maybe they were right he is better than me. I‚Äôm fucked and I don‚Äôt see a reason of continuing on with this nightmare. Everyone is building their life, and I feel like my life is a joke. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have no foundation. I‚Äôm in a hole and the walls feel so slippery. I can‚Äôt crawl out. Anxiety, inferiority complex, depression haunt me like a ghost. Im getting older and uglier I just wanna die. Im burned out every single day. Im such an awful person I always find myself struggling to communicate and saying things I regret and ruminate about every social interaction. I always have to scheme a plan if I feel like I want to tell something nice to a person without sounding too needy or clingy. Im tired of this existence. Im too terrible for routines or to go to the doctor. I CAN‚ÄôT decide where to put my money on cause I don‚Äôt know which doctor/psychiatrist/psychologist is better. everything is so overwhelming and I‚Äôm always wondering what other people are doing, how they are handling adulthood, instead of focusing on myself. im stuck in this 9 to 5 job cause I just can‚Äôt figure a way out.. I can‚Äôt figure out a plan and time is passing by and I feel so overwhelmed I don‚Äôt wanna be left behind , even tho i already am. I don‚Äôt wanna be behind my peers I really don‚Äôt but I can‚Äôt figure out anything and I just want something that makes sense but everything is so overwhelming my mind gets filled with screams when I burn out after the first 3 hours of the day, I feel depleted to do anything. I can‚Äôt stop the nervous anxious feeling in my stomach when I wake up‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs almost like my brain¬† is playing the same broken record over and over: ‚Äúim a virgin friendless loser I‚Äôm so behind I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing career wise I suck at adulthood, minor problems throw me off, I still live with my mom cause the only places I can afford in this country are located in very dangerous neighborhoods and the conditions are terrible and I fear I might get stuck in those scary dark places, people are getting married people are good at what they do and are advancing in their careers‚Ä¶.‚Äù And I can‚Äôt stop the constant morning rumination before going to my miserable job, I can‚Äôt stop looking at my phone on the toilet obsessing over leaving to a better country, having a nice apartment, traveling the world every year, having a social life, wholesome friends, camping, going places, film making, but everything takes time and effort and I just can‚Äôt deal with it‚Ä¶ cause I‚Äôll have to ignore my demons and constant inner conflict. that daily morning rumination won‚Äôt allow me to do a routine properly or even take care of myself, nothing seems adequate, and I end up running late to work in a rush, barely eating breakfast, barely showering, barely brushing my teeth, I wait until the last minute and then my stress¬† pushes me into action and I still get an hour late to work feeling exhausted hungry¬† stressed out looking terrible and wanting to kill myself because I will have to save face and pretend I‚Äôm okay for 8 hours straight. This is prison.¬† When I burn out I get compulsive crazy thoughts like ‚Äúporn porn porn‚Äù and ‚ÄúI hate myself I‚Äôm too weak I get extremely tired for nothing, I won‚Äôt amount to anything‚Äù ‚Äúwhat the fck am I even doing‚Äù or I obsess over my attractive coworker and try to ovehear everything he says in the next hall instead of focusing on my job. (he will be leaving to another company soon btw¬†üì∑¬†and I‚Äôm just sad cause it‚Äôs always the same pattern when I feel attracted to someone, they leave and I stay with the illusion, bottled up words and unresolved feelings‚Ä¶ on his first day I was like ‚Äúoh he is just a cute guy‚Äù but then he intentionally approached to me and was so friendly to me even when I didn‚Äôt do anything deserving of that kind of treatment‚Ä¶. I kinda envy the other gay guy at my job cause he is always talking to my crush and he is so unapologetically gay and looks better than me. My crush is 27 and just found out he is not even gay cause he is apparently married and¬† has a one year old daughter but he is so supportive for other people and I heard him defending gay people in an argument and I was like ‚ÄúAwüì∑‚Äù idk he is so wholesome, positive and adorable even tho he literally looks like an Adonis. When he¬† smiles and laughs he looks so innocent, it‚Äôs so cute, and¬† I feel attracted to him even as a possible friend but I‚Äôm too shy to even do anything about it, I feel like I have negative energy and I feel like I ruin everything I touch, so I feel like he is too pure for a person like me, and as I said he is leaving soon. I‚Äôm such a pathetic loser.¬† My porn addiction has been so bad I keep porn on my gallery and I stopped caring about going out with my phone full of porn sometimes I even forget about it‚Ä¶ I used to delete everything before going somewhere but I got tired of that. now that I think about it ‚Ä¶ there should‚Äôve been a time at work or somewhere else were I accidentally opened up my gallery without noticing and porn was displayed on my screen and now I‚Äôm forever paranoid ‚Äúwhat if people saw it and never said anything and that‚Äôs why I can feel their contempt and disgust towards me?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if some virus got on my phone and started sending porn to my contacts without noticing and I never knew about it?‚Äù My porn kinks are weird: i fantasize about being humiliated and inferior. I imagine myself being the size of a peanut in comparison to a giant gorgeous guy with muscular body big cock and ass. I imagine them sitting on me, spitting on me, farting on me, using me as a human buttplug, using me as their toilet paper, laughing at my tiny worthless existence. II‚Äôm into eproctophilia¬† macrophilia‚Ä¶ i remember I was like 5 or 6 and I was fantasizing about a boy and asking god to turn him into a giant just because i found that fascinating little did I know I had a weird inferiority complex that turned into a fictional fetish and it‚Äôs probably due to the absence of a father figure in my entire childhood. I feel so ashamed and guilty because my mom has had to notice and wash my stinky underwear filled with cum‚Ä¶ i know I traumatized her. I feel lost and I feel like I don‚Äôt have a place in this world. Everything feels triggering and scary.¬† Natural selection will soon take care of me I don‚Äôt even have to do it myself (although I may). My body is shutting down my brain is literally fuming and can‚Äôt think rationally and I‚Äôm more prone to deathly accidents because of my constant staggering lethargic walk, poor mobility, attention deficit, social anxiety, compulsive thoughts, frustration and paranoia. I feel like I have no personality nothing to be proud of nothing that makes me feel genuinely confident around others. I just feel like shit everywhere I go. Everyone is so full of personalities and I‚Äôm just lost. My main issue is that I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life I‚Äôm and adult and I should be working on something I have so many plans but I can‚Äôt decide and doing everything simultaneously will be a terrible idea knowing how easily I burn out, my career is in shambles, i don‚Äôt have a partner, im alone, cause i want to leave my country¬† asap¬† and don‚Äôt wanna have emotional strings to this country but I CAN‚ÄôT decide where to go or how,¬† I don‚Äôt see future here, I feel stuck, nothing feels like me. I belong nowhere. I feel so different. I even feel weird when I talk like people from my country, the slang, the culture, even the music feels so unfamiliar to me. I‚Äôm too ruined. Everything that I‚Äôve written here‚Ä¶ every single thing is my bread and butter. Every frustration I mentioned appears in my head every day like a broken record and it‚Äôs so debilitating, dehumanizing and frustrating it‚Äôs hard to get over and ignore these feelings every day‚Ä¶ so hard. I really think I‚Äôll never be able to make it through this 11 year old never ending phase. It has stained my youth forever and it‚Äôs going downhill from here. I feel so worthless my dignity is not even there anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Sorry for bothering you with this sob story",1.0,2.0,0.0,2.0

But I'm good at pushing things off and getting to things when I get to things. Honestly I feel like a shell of a person, not happy not sad just running through the motions of life. When going out, I usually putting on the mask of I'm a normal person having a good time. I walk around home feeling sorrow, or like I've lost someone in my life, or nothing at all.. I've been married for 13 years now, and she's ready to leave or is leaving. I've never been a touchy feely type guy. My wife on the other hand is, she wants to talk and I never have anything to talk about. I've been working from home since covid so nothing really going on in my life. She was working from home for some time but she still expected to have a conversation about something, I work in IT and don't like explaining what I do. It seems like pointless information for her. That leaves me very little to talk about. I have no idea how my relationships start off so ""well"" then dwindle into me just being an empty man. She says she is jealous of my co-workers, she hears me in meetings with them and says I'm having a good time. I have no idea why I can be that person for meetings and not for my home life. Really I don't understand why dont have a normal set of feelings.

The worst part is when she was leaving I was upset for about an hour or hour and half then I went back to being my empty self again.

I highly doubt how I feel is anywhere close to what others are feeling. I've also been on medications for 20ish years and I feel the pursuit of happiness is a waste of time. Really when I was thinking of posting before, it was because about once a day I was having bad thoughts (we will keep it PG). I don't talk about those thoughts because it just causes people to be overconserned and give suggestions that I feel like they are basic or a waste of time. Then when I talk to my Doctor it's just upping medications or trying some new medication.

Anyhow, with this post it got a bit derailed since my wife is sick of my $#!t and I don't blame her. If I wasnt happy for the last three years I would try to move on also. I had other things I wanted to add but I feel like that would just make the post way too long.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

770,t3_yoa30p,depression,"i have no one to tell this to, so ill just type it here like the rest of us","A couple years ago i was growing increasingly lonely, depressed, and empty. I started using lots of drugs to cope with it and of course it was great at first. I could actually communicate with people for once and had a friend, we werent real friends just a couple of addicts with no one else. but it was the closest ive ever had to a friend.

I kept using more and more because everytime id come down from a high i would feel a huge void of emptiness inside me that kept growing. I was using pain pills, anxiety pills, stimulant pills, psychedelics, dissociatives, deliriants, drinking and of course smoking weed all day. I was still a minor at this point

The unhappiness kept growing inside me until one day i took so much and went on a drive hoping id end up dead or in jail because i couldnt take it anymore and well thats exactly what happened 

Thankfully i got sober because of my arrest and now im in college and depression is fucking me everyday. Everything makes me sad, seeing nature, seeing life go by and people going about their business knowing i have no friends and never have connected to anyone deeply not even my family members. Theres always huge barriers up and im always on my toes because theres things in my head stuck and wreaking havoc that im not allowed to talk about.

I have no social skills. I can show up to class and do my work but i have to sit away from everyone or social anxiety will start really affecting me. I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin and im always living in my head. Theres a huge disconnect between me and reality. My brain and body are damaged from using drugs to deal with depression and I hate living knowing that I made myself less intelligent and less healthy because I just wanted a few hours of relief from my pain. I hate looking at my gross body with spots all over it from disease and self harm. everytime i see a mirror i just compulsively say fuck you or i hate you.

I have clinically diagnosed depression and social anxiety on top of probably some other stuff going on, including other kinds of anxiety. It was a simple job working at a store. The pay was decent, well above minimum wage. I didn't expect to get the job to begin with, so I was excited.

I was supposed to come in on my first day to handle some training and onboarding type stuff.

It was as though I could feel the pressure of having to go to work and perform at my best while also constantly talking to people every day looming over me, and I in the moment wanted no part of it. I now intensely regret this decision, since it took a lot of effort to even find this job (part time entry level jobs are rare where I live) and it would take a while to get one like it, let alone with half decent pay.

I never took it seriously because I know I would never do it. I never self harmed and I wouldn't actually kill myself although I've thought about suicide a lot.

I have 3 siblings who all have diagnosed mental health issues. I'm the youngest. We all had happy (near perfect) childhoods, and they developed their issues during or after college. All 3 are in therapy and on meds.

I've always been the ""normal"" sibling. I'm also the baby and all of them love to ""spoil"" me and see me happy. My mom has a lot of guilt over my siblings, thinking that she's somehow at fault for my siblings' issues. She's told me before that she sees me sort of as proof that she wasn't wrong for having kids. I've never had a problem confiding in them when I'm low, but low is not the same and clinically depressed, and I feel like it'll break their hearts if it turns out I too have issues. 

Lately I've been feeling worse. I moved to a different country and things were going great but then I lost my job. I've been job hunting for months, but my immigration status has been a huge roadblock. I blew through my savings and now my parents are helping me with rent. The job prospects in my industry are pretty shit back home. I'll get a job but it won't pay much, and I have a student loan. I feel stuck, I feel awful, I feel like I fucked up big time. I'm mid 20s, I don't have a job and my parents are paying my rent. They owned a business so we used to be financially okay, but covid hit hard and they had to shut down. They went back to work and we aren't struggling but I want to earn enough so they can retire! 

I don't know how I ended up here. I was a ""gifted"" child, and everyone around me always said I have great potential, but I think I fucked it all up. I had all this potential but I made awful decisions and messed everything up. I feel like there's no going back and I'm never going to be happy again. 

Lately I've been saying ""I'm so depressed"" in my head all the time, and today it just struck me, what if I actually am? I don't self harm but when I'm low I don't eat, I've gone 2 days without eating anything. Is that self harm? Some days I'm so low I just don't do anything. Like I know I should be applying for jobs and following up with any leads but I just can't do anything. I get headaches often because of the stress of it all.

I took up an unpaid internship since they didn't care about my visa status, I thought it would help in interviews if I said I'm currently working at xyz, instead of I'm currently unemployed. They also might hire a couple of the interns in a few months, so I want to do well. But my brain keeps shutting down. I'm SO SLOW at my work suddenly. I've been crying a lot and I keep re reading old books because then I don't have to think about any of it. But when I stop I feel guilty for wasting time sitting and reading nonsense when I don't have a job and there's so much to do.

Expectations: November 7th
I'm going to be:
- Miserable when I wake up
- Hungry until lunch because I wasn't hungry in the morning and everything feels like it would be disgusting when I picture myself eating it
- Caught off guard by a forgotten biology assignment because the grand bitch doesn't post anything on canvas
- Annoyed by my teacher's voice and her condescending nature
- Bored out of my mind in bio and miss a lot of stuff
- Embarrassed by Mr. V's required reading (which he does out loud, to a nerve-racking degree)
- Questioned and criticized by my new tablemates, who I have offended through being mean (which I will be reminded of just by looking at A) and questioning my dark interests and treating me like a serial killer fangirl or future serial killer even though I'm not
- Have all my ideas be dismissed and be ignored even though I've been writing for years more than these girls and be anxious about whether I'm trying to dominate the thing
- Feeling alone in the world except for my mom and feeling embarrassed that I'm a momma's girl
- Have to write a play I have no motivation or desire to write
- Missing my old tablemates who were far less judgmental about my interests (why did he have to move me? What if I can't change his mind?)
- Be completely lost in Spanish class because my long-term memory is fucked and she posts nothing on canvas either
- Cry during Spanish class because I don't understand anything
- Have no friends in Spanish class
- Completing an assignment that I probably won't have to turn in because she ""likes to keep us on our toes"" and usually only makes us turn in one assignment out of 5
- Have to listen to the annoying voice of my old fashioned teacher who lectures us about how much better the kids in Spain are and always repeats herself
- Having to listen to the kid who asks stupid questions on purpose to annoy the teacher and want to rip his throat out and being guilty for thinking that way
- Forget that it's not a ""dressing out day"" for P.E and walk into the classroom late and embarrassed 
- Be embarrassed and try to cover my ears during sex ed
- Think about my 2nd year course selection sheet anxiously 
- Be berated by my English teacher for something a student did three years ago

I'm fifteen if this will make the story more clear. 

Since late this year, I have been talking to the school counsellors. Everything was going well, I felt comfortable to tell them about my past (bullying and a lousy attempt of suicide). I've also told them about my home life, which was a mistake. I'm not getting abused, but I told them about my mom's bf, etc. Also about my depressive moods. 

I thought it was okay, but it wasn't. Counsellor made a report, now my life is officially ruined. My mom's life is even worse. I've made her extremely stressed (more so with the report), and I just don't know what to do. I've been trying to take it day by day. I don't know how to feel. I feel awful of course, but I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. It's my fault, and I don't know how to make it better. There probably is no way. 

They (the people who the report was sent to) are visiting Tuesday. Maybe I will update then.

808,t3_yo7muj,depression,How to quit being a quitter?,"So I‚Äôm fairly confident I‚Äôm depressed. If the diagnosis of 2 therapists and consensus among my friends is any testimony, I‚Äôm depressed. And one of the most common ways this manifests is as quitting. I‚Äôm not a very motivated person, it doesn‚Äôt take much of a trip for me to give up. I‚Äôm negative, I struggle to find positivity, so I‚Äôm quick to degrade myself and find excuses to give up.

For example, I used to paint minis. I was working on a dragon I bought, just painting the base a sandy color and trying to decide what to do with the big rocky perch the dragon sits on. But the color didn‚Äôt look right. It was pretty ugly. So I stopped for the day. This was several months ago. I haven‚Äôt touched my paints since. Because every time I go down to my basement, I see the unfinished ugly base, and leave. I quit.

And the thing is, I always quit. I tried learning guitar, quit. Keyboard, quit. Music production in general via FL, quit. Animation, quit. Drawing, quit. 3D modeling, quit. Journaling, quit. TTRPG design, quit. Programming, pretending I haven‚Äôt quit yet, but haven‚Äôt done anything in weeks. The effort I need to put in stops being worth the joy I derive from doing it. For some things, it‚Äôs immediate, like with drawing. With others, it took some time, like with painting minis. I made a few good ones before I hit a hurdle.

I feel unsatisfied, like I‚Äôm wasting my life, my only real hobby is playing video games, and that‚Äôs kinda pathetic. So I tear into myself for being a loser, and try to find some new outlet, until I inevitably lose inspiration and have another spiral.

So, how do I stop? Do I do this because I‚Äôm depressed, or am I depressed because I do this? How do you find reasons to keep at it? How to you ignore the very loud voice in your head telling you to give up? Does the voice ever go away? And how do you change to a positive outlook? How do I learn to enjoy the journey?",0.81,3.0,0.0,3.0

814,t3_yo6vke,depression,"Urgent - Tics, OCD, compulsions, paralysis‚Ä¶help!","Hi guys,

I'm writing this post today with the hope that some people will be able to connect with the current symptoms and nightmare that I've been living with for the past 3 months and help me decipher what the hell is actually going on.

2 years ago, something pretty traumatic happened to me. I was shocked by the situation, but still pretty lucid and 'normal'. While this traumatic situation was going on, I made the mistake to smoke CBD ""joints"" to spend time while I was trying to figure out what I was going to do: huge mistake.

One of these joints sent me on a long way down to hell, and it seems like it's only worsening with time.

First things first , it all started with feeling 'weird' after I had smoked, followed by a huge panick attack. This attack brought on huge insomnia crisis (plural) that would last up to 7-10 days where I'd be able to sleep roughly 30 min/night and send me into a sinkhole of more anxiety and trauma/fear.

I spent months into this 'bizarre' and traumatic state until it 'calmed' little by little, and let place to a pretty sudden...OCD. I freaked the fuck out. I always had heard of it but never felt or understood it. And suddendly, I had to think a certain thing, being in a certain place, watching a precise spot for it to feel 'right'.

Then followed all the different and infamous hand washing, door closing, counting, decrypting, perfecting &amp; co OCD. The compulsions turnover was absolutely insane and litteraly absolutely everything went through it: my ability to project things in my mind, my thoughts, my thoughts process, my vision, my eyes, my texts, my reading, my writing...I went insane and at some point to accept using Zoloft to help myself out.

(Note: Since the OCD started, I've been feeling daily insane movement and pressure inside my head, cracking, popping, you name it. I felt it daily and I'm still feeling it to this day and no psychiatrist is able to put a name on what it could possibly be. Also, anytime I would try not indulge a compulsion, my brain would trigger this 'suffering' feeling and start making me do the action of crying for a few seconds.)

The Zoloft helped the 'physical' compulsion but not the mental ones. Also, I started having weird brain contractions and head movement appearing little by little.

After 10 months on Zoloft, I decided to try something different because it helped but...it was still not quite that. So I made a move and decided to go for a switch on Effexor/Venlafaxine - huge mistake.

After a couple of weeks while switching from Sertraline to Venlafaxine, I started feeling dreadful anxiety again. Not only that, but my head movements, jerks &amp; co started increasing more and more.

After a couple of months (and still upping my dose little by little to complete this transition between the two medications), not only my anxiety kept on raising, but my brain started shutting down my eyes and do some crazy eye movements/vibrations, then came blinking, mouth movement....I started really freaking out again and decided to backpedal and roll back on Zoloft.

While I was backpedaling on my medication, my brain contraction started getting worse and worse, I would stay stuck looking at something/someone, stuck looking behind my back, stuck while doing an action or contracting/stretching (impossible to stop it), and the worse of the worse, paralysed: impossible to move. I've stayed stuck in places for hours in the same position and my body/eyes would start shaking like crazy if I'd try to force and move, and intense anxiety will start going through my body. I also recently had yelling that came out as a reaction of trying to force it out as well.

Overall, anytime I think of doing an action, my brain will contract and stop me from doing it. I will force, I won't be able to do it or at least not at all in a normal way, and I will stay stuck trying to do it until I manage, which will make my brain contract even more and involve so much suffering and anxiety.

I'm getting so desperate and sad, I'm unable to take care of myself hygienically, eat properly, do any activities or socialise because of all this since 3 full months and it's really starting to have a huge toll on me.

All these symptoms remained despite me getting back on Zoloft for 2 months and the anxiety is either high or super high.

I tried Levetiracetam during a week and it didn't help much. I tried Quietapine during a week and I started feeling sick of life. I need help.

Even if just one of you people can take something away from this, then my purpose would be fulfilled.

- Make the best of the job you have, even if it sucks bigtime. What really helped for me was trying to be a good colleague and friend to my coworkers. A lot of them didn't like the work either. Putting a smile on their face, or trying to get along with someone I didn't click with helped me tremendously to the point where I started liking what I did. 
- Stay away from porn. I know the noFap people and No nut November types can make the whole staying away from porn &amp; masturbation thing seem super cringy. It however truly has some great potential mental health benefits. It can really differ per individual to what level this helps. But for me personally it has done wonders.
- Work out. Or sports in general. There are probably a billion reasons as to why this is a good idea. I personally like to do a callisthenics workout, and I also indulge in Muay Thai. Combat sports have really helped with my level of confidence as well. 

I am by no means a therapist/psychologist or mental health expert. This is just what has worked for me. I still struggle and the D-word does still come for me pretty heavy from time to time. 
But by taking care of myself through little things like these I always managed to pull through every time so far.

One positive interaction at work.

I've struggled with this for a long time. Lately I've been fantasising about being free of stimulus and sensation. I was really building up in my head that going to a float pod (sensory deprivation tank) would allow me to 'escape'. 

But when I was in there, my neck hurt. I can not escape my body. Buddhist monks still feel every sensation - muscle pains, discomfort, thirst. The body is never fully  satiated. I realised how much of me just wants to be free of it all. 

If sentience is suffering, how am I meant to accept being alive? How is it okay? Why is the answer for us not to prevent and end sentience? Monks learn to become 'equanimous' with sensations, but I feel it's such an intense practice to achieve that, I don't feel I could learn to fully accept pain.

831,t3_yo5pps,depression,having a partner seems to be the hardest part of having depression,"I don't have many friends, and my family knows I disappear sometimes, so it's usually easy for me to isolate and deal with things myself. having a partner puts a wrench in the works. the irritability and hate I feel now has somewhere to go other than my mind. I can't keep it together in front of them and I can't isolate myself. I tried to isolate myself but that doesn't work when someone actually wants your company. of course depression is saying why the hell would they want to be around you which is creating a horrible loop. 

I can't be a good partner and I need to be. The disappointment and anger and sadness and numbness are far too much to share. I feel like I want to run away from the relationship just so I'm not a burden.

834,t3_yo5f1v,depression,Drugs and Depression,"Growing up I had a traumatic childhood and never really had anyone who was emotionally there for me. Because of this I grew up with depression, anxiety, and a lot of other issues. Even as a teenager I didn‚Äôt have people I could trust to talk to and let some of these emotions out so they all just built up inside of me. All of this led to multiple suicide attempts with my first one being when I was 10. At one point I had a girlfriend who helped me open up to her and other people which actually helped me. However eventually she became emotionally abusive towards me and made me feel like shit for talking to her. Because of this I really haven‚Äôt been able to talk to others and just keep everything I‚Äôm going through to myself. I know it‚Äôs not ok for me to do this but I can‚Äôt bring myself to talk to anyone after what I went through with her. I emotionally isolated myself from anyone and just had myself to rely on. My mental health continued to worsen and I kept trying to kill myself. In an attempt to help myself I started doing drugs which kind of helps but now I‚Äôm addicted. I feel hopeless and like things will never get better for me. I‚Äôve tried many healthy ways to help myself and none of them have worked.

Our relationship got strained as we were always with each other and we lived in a terraced house with neighbours either side that we didnt get on with. It was a horrible living environment. At the end of covid we moved to a new house, but the negativity followed us. We  tried online couples therapy and we didnt get on with it ( the therapist basically said it was all her fault) we stopped doing the therapy and told ourselves we would have to do it ourselves. In the background I started getting really insular. If I was upset she would ask if I was okay and I would say yes and keep it bottled up. This got to the point where I felt so shit about myself and feeling like i had no way to release that I ended it with her. 

This is where it gets complicated.

I've read books, articles, reddit posts... I've even made and deleted several reddit accounts asking for help for this to prevent the shame of having to keep asking in different subreddits on the same account. The people I know can't or won't help me with this issue. I see people I know talk for hours on the phone, then in person, then over text and they just never run out of things to talk about and are fully engaged and interested in each other. I've never had this and anything I've used just doesn't work. People give me a two word answer to the exact same question they give others reems of info about their feelings and experiences. Hearing ""yeah it was OK"" and ""yeah I'm alright"" just makes me so angry and sad now.

anyway by my 15th birthday i'd say i was at my 'hollow and empty' phase where i felt kinda numb. i still felt happy sometimes, but usually i just felt far away from everything and numb

but now it's worse, bc i feel far emptier and hollower than before. not just that but i'd say i'm not enjoying myself at any point for more than 15 seconds, with very rare exceptions. also, this 'emptiness' is different now. i used to feel nothing, or close to nothing, but now i have to put in a little effort to feel empty, because if i don't then i feel terrible, absolutely weak all over. i lose the motivation to go and get a glass of water, or even just to fucking get up and turn on the light even though the switch is 4 steps away.

sometimes i consider cutting, but i stop myself bc someone would catch on very soon. in fact i recently showed a surgery scar on my elbow to some people in my art class at college, but i didn't give context as to what it was. the first thing someone said was 'did you do that' lmao. anyway yeah some people clearly already suspect me before i've even done it so it's kinda off the table. i get by occasionally punching myself tho

848,t3_yo3zln,depression,I don‚Äôt know where to go from here.,"My (F22) entire life is falling apart. I just found out my boyfriend of 3 years has been cheating on me. He has been one of the most emotionally and mentally abusive people i ever interacted with but when you have no one else you sometimes think that even this is better than nothing. I live in fear of his volatile reactions and did my best to support him in every way only to always fall short. I am always in the wrong according to him.I‚Äôm at my highest weight possible and am definitely overweight according to my height. I have a job that I love but will probably get fired from because I haven‚Äôt been able to graduate college, they knew i didnt have my degree when I was hired but two months in they obviously expect that I will be presenting it soon. I have to reveal this to them soon which means leaving the job and disappointing my parents and everyone i worked with. It had finally given me a bit of motivation. Something to work towards. I‚Äôve taken almost 2 years extra to finish my degree and still havent been able to. I‚Äôve been trying to recover from a horrible knee injury, that left me bed ridden for weeks. Everyone around me believes that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. I just moved back to my home country after spending a few months in the country I attended Uni in. Moving back has been so hard because i dont know how to tell anyone that i moved back because I couldn‚Äôt afford to live outside of my parents home anymore. Now that I am back, all my parents to is either shout and scream at each other or tell me what a big disappointment I am. I am my mothers emotional dump bucket. For the good and the bad. Most people use alarm clocks to wake up. Mine is my mother telling me what a waste of life I am first thing in the morning. My father doesnt speak to me and when he does, its only about finances or to tell me how much of a waste I am. I sometimes look to my sister for help but have stopped doing that too because all I get told is ‚Äúyou brought it upon yourself‚Äù. I have been dealing with anxiety since I was 12 when I froze up on stage while participating in a debate. Before that day, I had never lost anything. Gotten a grade below an A.Had any disciplinary issues with anyone including my parents. Since then, I‚Äôve had crippling anxiety with any ‚Äúperformances‚Äù of sorts. With any display whatsoever. I slipped into heavy depression right after I moved to uni. I visited multiple therapists, one of whom was very clear with my parents about where I could be in my life mentally. They still dont belive its real. That its a convenient excuse for me. That all the therapists want is my money. They will diagnose if that meant a regular income from me. My ‚Äúfriends‚Äù are all unrealiable and for the lack of a better term, snakes. I never know who is lying and who is not. They had a huge role to play in my boyfriends indiscretion. None of them told me. I was left to put the pieces together all by myself as I still am doing. Because they just didn‚Äôt want to be involved or bothered by the drama. If they had the chance, they would all throw me under the bus without second thought. Last month, I lost my pet who seemed to be last ‚Äúperson‚Äù I could turn to for some support. The only thing is my life that brings me comfort is sleep. I feel like I‚Äôm letting my brain rot by just wanting to eat,sleep and do nothing else all day. I dont want to talk to anyone nor do i have anyone to turn to. I dont have the luxury of a comfort space anymore. I always thought and was told whenever I brought up the things I am going through, that I was emotionally strong and can take anything that comes my way. I‚Äôm clearly failing at life. Just because I‚Äôm physically here doesnt mean that I am coping. This is not what resilience is. For years, its now been one thing after the other to deal with. The next thing happens even before I have time to handle the first one. I have no grip on reality anymore. I feel like i am just observing everything happening from the outside. I look in the mirror and just don‚Äôt recognise myself anymore. I make the silliest of mistakes now. I forget absolutely everything important. All day long it feels like my brain is not thinking about anything. Whenever something happens now, i dont have a reaction beyond ‚Äúhm‚Äù. I‚Äôll have people screaming at me and all I can do just stare back and them and take it. I want to move forward but just get pulled down everyday. I dont know where to start. I feel so guilty for relying on people and my parents. I have wasted all the time, energy and money my parents have invested in me. I used to be smart, attentive,funny and full of energy. I had a sense of adventure. I had my entire career plans figured out. I knew the person i wanted to be. I have lost all of that. I despise myself because im only surrounded my negativity. The only emotion I feel is anger. Deep deep rage. It feels like a growing bubble that will burst any minute. For everything and anyone. I hate leaving my bed or my bedroom or someone in this space.

A little back info: I‚Äôm in my late 30‚Äôs &amp; had depression issues shortly after I hit my teens &amp; been on various depression meds since (Prozac, Trintillex, etc.).  At present for the last 3 yrs I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin 150mg/day.  I‚Äôm also on Concerta 36mg/day for ADHD.

I find it works ok but my question for those on depression meds and just depression in general: do you ever have regular occasions when for no reason you suddenly feel scared of everything/anything and feeling of impending doom that something bad is going to happen or that you are a total failure in everything, absolutely no self-confidence and feel like your drowning?

Then, even sometimes the same day, it‚Äôs like a complete 180: who cares what happens/I can handle anything/nothing bothers me/bring on anything and you feel you could face any challenge with total confidence and no fear.

Example: Omg mortgage rates have risen &amp; I am up for renewal it‚Äôs going to be so high - how will I manage‚Ä¶?!  What if I fall behind on my payments?!  What if I lose my job.

Then fast fwd maybe the next day the same thought about rates rising and my mind says: yep the rates are rising but I‚Äôm sure everything will be fine.  I lose my job it is what it is and I will find another - can‚Äôt worry about what I can‚Äôt control - I got this.

858,t3_yo2fn0,depression,Anxiety of taking pills,"I, 22M, have been on Escitalopram for depression (no anxiety) with almost no side effects and prescribed Xanax for emergencies. After some time the escitalopram stopped working and I started taking paroxetine, which worsened my condition, and after a dose increase it completely messed me up and I had started tapering off of it. Even with the tapering process I became ill due to severe withdrawal symptoms which I suffered through for a week until I could get an appointment with my GP. The doctor claimed I have unexpectedly high susceptibility to this sort of medications (SSRIs) and dosage increase/tapering should be done more gradually than usual. So I started taking sertraline which helped my depression but made me nauseous (beyond the usual 2 weeks of normal side effects) and also, based on what other people told me, made me quite aggressive and irritable. So I went back to escitalopram, but a new psychiatrist that I decided to visit decided that I should go off escitalopram and start taking fluoexetine, he suggested I drop the 10 mg of escitalopram I was on (in the beginning I was at max dose of 20 mg) for two days and start the new drug, I explained what happened with the paroxetine and that I don't think I can go through this sort of extreme withdrawal again, so he suggested I taper off of it by taking 5 mg for 10 days, wait 2 days and then star the fluoexetine. Two days after I lowered the dose I became sick again, due to withdrawal (recognized it right away) and it was WAY worse than the first time, I was unable to function let alone go to work. I live alone and quite far from my parents, don't really have any close friends, and I was having non-stop crying fits and panic attacks, nausea, diarrhea even puked a couple of times due to stress. I tried to reach the psychiatrist but to no avail...I had to go back to my parents as I was afraid of harming myself, the psychiatrist answered my message a week later asking why I was even taking the escitalopram when he instructed me to take fluoexetine...I had a piece of paper with his instructions where what I previously wrote was clearly stated...I found a new and expensive psychiatrist and went to her for guidance and she suggested I take mirtazapine, but I couldn't do it. Every pill I take, even ones I took before (Xanax even) make me anxious to the point of panicking out of fear from having a bad reaction or even an allergic reaction (which I have only had for penicilin when I was 7, once), I never had anxiety before and even the Xanax was for when I feel extreme sadness and not for anxiety, so now I have anxiety too and I am afraid of taking the new pills and am kinda lost...Any suggestions on how to move forward from here will be appreciated. 
To be clear, when I realized the psychiatrist, who barely took family history from me and mocked me for the reason I was depressed during our meeting, didn't remember his own medication plan I didn't bother taking the fluoexetine and simply waited on 5 mg of escitalopram until my meeting with the new psychiatrist, which was today.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

I want to visit home for winter but I have nothing left in my hometown. I don‚Äôt have the best relationship with my best friend or anyone and my house is filled with memories of the childhood friend who passed away. I‚Äôm terribly anxious to go back. 

I want to go to therapy again but I can‚Äôt afford it on my own and I can‚Äôt ask my dad to pay for it cause it‚Äôs so fucking expensive. I can‚Äôt let my parents in on any of this because they‚Äôre happy for me right now and think I‚Äôm doing great.

I have no real point to existing. 
My gf, who I was very serious about for two years now, just dumped me because we live in different countries and she can't move here, but because I'm disabled, there's no chance I'd be able to move there, either. We had even been discussing what we'd name our future kids. And then suddenly, she felt there was no hope nor future for us, and she dumped me at five am one morning out of the blue. Which also leads me to wonder how long she'd been hiding that from me, too, tbh.  
After the break up, we tried to stay friends, but it failed, so she removed herself from my life completely, which stings just as much as the break up did. Maybe more. Maybe just the same. I'm not sure.

I have three online friends, and two friends that I live with, one so close we call each other siblings.

I am 20 years old, I am currently studying in another country (Erasmus year). I feel so numb. Lately, I've been dissociating a lot, it's like life isn't real. I look at the streets, trees, and buildings, and it's so weird. It doesn't feel real. I am having trouble feeling anything, and when I do I don't like it. I hate my thoughts. I hate my overthinking, I hate my anxiety. I don't like my brain and I don't know if I can live like this for the rest of my life. I want to talk to people but I only know them for one month and I don't know if they'll understand all of this. Sometimes when I think of telling someone about this I feel stupid, that these are not real problems and I have no right to complain, and I have to be grateful for the things I have. 

The only times I feel happy or ok it's when I am overstimulated or high. And being drunk or high it's being bad also lately. I don't know what to do. I feel overwhelmed. And I know if I meditate, if I write, if I go to therapy and breathe everything will be better but I am tired of going through this every week or month. It's like I will never be ok. I miss my friends back home, I see pictures of them on social media and I feel so alone. They are continuing with their lives and I am here.

But the people to distance myself from becomes more and more clear by the day‚Ä¶

Some people don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm doing, but at least they have enough faith in me that I‚Äôm trying different things with varying levels of reward and that I will make it work. I‚Äôm not just sitting on my ass at home all day twiddling my thumbs like the impression seems to be amongst some, I‚Äôm on track to something bigger. I appreciate that.

Then there‚Äôs the group that thinks they know what‚Äôs best for me and does have my best interest at heart, but what they envision for me and what I envision for myself are two completely different things. I don‚Äôt want to be confined to the box they want to put me in, and it‚Äôs hard to deal with these people. Often people I‚Äôm close to, family, so I just distance myself and say nothing. We‚Äôll talk about other things instead while I continue about my business without their support. It sucks, but it‚Äôs whatever.

Then there‚Äôs the group that‚Äôs jealous. It‚Äôs a smaller group, but it‚Äôs definitely there. Their criticism is based on what I haven‚Äôt done, and I‚Äôm sure if I had done those things, they‚Äôd find other things too that I hadn‚Äôt done to criticize. So to this group: fuck you and goodbye. We‚Äôll see where you‚Äôre at in 10 years.

If people want to be disappointed in me for not wanting to go the typical route of the 9-5 engineering job day in day out, then so be it. If that‚Äôs your biggest dream in life then good on you, but it‚Äôs not mine. That sounds so utterly boring to me, and I want to do something more creative. I feel like I‚Äôm meant to do something more creative than that. And if my confidence in that statement makes me cocky or makes people uncomfortable: so be it. This is me, it‚Äôs my life, I don‚Äôt have to please anyone else to support myself but me.

There‚Äôs also the implication that I‚Äôm struggling financially because I‚Äôve kept my PT retail job for now, and that I‚Äôm basically wasting my time.

Newsflash: I‚Äôm not struggling lol

Because my projects aren‚Äôt just failing lol

When you‚Äôre not confined to the 9-5 box, you don‚Äôt simply get comfortable with what you‚Äôre making and you get much more creative with the ways you can generate income.

The possibilities are endless, really.

I‚Äôve kept my retail job as some side income for now a few times a week, because it gets me out from behind my computer screen, it‚Äôs flexible, it‚Äôs dirt easy at this point, and I know everyone there loves me so it puts me in a better mood about myself for a bit. I don‚Äôt plan on keeping it forever, but why wouldn‚Äôt I keep it while I focus most of my time and energy on what I actually want to do long-term?

Or I could live how other people want me to, quit my PT job, get my 9-5, focus all my time and energy on that, then by the time I get home have no energy left to do what I actually want to do because I‚Äôve been using all that energy and creativeness completing something for someone else which isn‚Äôt even in my best interest, with a much smaller potential reward: financially and mentally.

I also don‚Äôt see the security a lot seem to see in the 9-5‚Ä¶ in fact I don‚Äôt see the security in it at all. What I‚Äôm doing is a risk? A 9-5 is a risk too!! Every company is the same whether we like to admit it or not, whether they say otherwise or not: profit comes before anything. The big boss can walk in at anytime, any day and tell you that you that you no longer have a job.

How is that **not** a risk?

I‚Äôd much rather be in control of my own career instead of unnecessarily worrying about when my expiry date is at some random company, accomplishing nothing that I actually want to do.

The choice seems easy to me: don‚Äôt waste my skills to make someone else wealthy doing something I feel forced to do instead of doing something I actually want to do.

I personally don't think I ever want to tell my parents that I have depression. My parents being my parents, will react in ways and act in ways that I really don't wanna go through. Not only that, I just don't think I can bare to tell them from a personal level. As I haven't really told anyone besides maybe 1 person, that I have depression.
Me not telling my parents have some bad affects, like my father reacting very harsh on some things that I do which are causes of symptoms(which he doesn't know about, nor does he know they are symptoms of depression), and my mother being ""worried sick"" and continuously asks me to do things I don't want to or can do(like go out of my room and spend time with them).
Is it better to tell them?
Should I just step up and do it?
Because I really don't want to tell them, but there are bad disadvantages to not telling them, and I think eventually they will understand on their own one day(they already did, but I denied it).
But also, if I did tell them, that would follow up with a massive change in behavior from my parents towards me, which I really don't want to, because it's just gonna make me feel so much more alienated and ill.

i have always CRAVED for friendships my entire life, people to do things with so i don‚Äôt feel lonely but haven‚Äôt got it yet, some people i gave my all to but they didn‚Äôt seem interested in doing things with me or even text first, i got rid of them and now i‚Äôm friendless  

everyday is the same, i try to pass my days by doing the bare minimum, being online to distract myself from reality and wait for night  

i simply don‚Äôt want to exist, i wish i never existed and i just can‚Äôt wait to die  i wonder if i will always be this miserable, what if my uni and work life look like this? doing bare minimum and can‚Äôt wait to get back home, at least i will have money then ig that‚Äôs nice  

sometimes i wonder if i should get a camper van and live on road but even that is off putting idk life makes me feel sick idk who i am and i wanna disappear not die just simply disappear",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
885,t3_yny3m0,depression,Better?,"I can't tell if I'm getting better. Sometimes it feels like it, and sometimes it doesn't. My medication makes me feel anhedonia, which is problematic. There are also a lot of factors that play into my life and how I'm feeling.

My outlook on things also changes. Sometimes I feel like things will be better faster, and sometimes I think it's going to be a long time before it happens. And things seem more or less interesting, depending on how I feel. And some things GET more or less interesting as well.

Overall, I AM doing better than before, but I have a feeling the incline will be slow. Depression or no depression, my life isn't very good right now. I know things will get better though.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

887,t3_ynxqfq,depression,"My ""friends"" keep leaving me in the dark","Hi,

This is my first ever post here on reddit, but I did not know where to turn to.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my life I have had a few close friends and alot of people that I know and hang out with but don¬¥t know to the depth. So no ""real friends"".

What I have noticed is that ALL my of my so called close friends slowly but surely disapear from my life and it has been like this my WHOLE life, even as a kid. I have always been the one that drops everything and goes to someone if they need me, but as I got older I started to notice that the people that were in my life that I counted as my friends only reached out if they wanted something. It could go weeks/months without me hearing anything unless I reached out. 

Eventually I stopped reaching out and those friendships just went away silently in the night never to be heard from again. (Some of these people I had once counted on beeing in my future wedding party).

I finaly got  diagnosed with depression and anxiety a year go when I got a burn out. However I know I have been battling with depression most of my life cuz of life stuff.

Everybody says how important it is to have friends around you when you are depressed but I feel like I am in a really deep and dark hole that I have problem getting out of now and NOBODY to pull me out.

I have 2 friends I would say IRL, BUT again (just like when I was younger (I am f34 now)) I never hear from them unless I am the one suggesting we should meet. They have thier own lifes with stuff but even a text with how are you is nothing that ever happens from thier part.

For nearly a year now I have been playing games online with a group of friends that I met ingame and I got included in that group. I did not feel so alone anymore since I could just hop in on Discord and talk even if we did not play the same game at that moment. One guy even started to see me as his big sister (he is alot younger then me) and asked me about relationship advise and everything from a-z. I saw him as my little brother and I told him about the ups and down in my life from loosing jobs, gettinga divorce etc. He called me often his best friend and said that I just had to text or call him whenever I was down.

2 days ago I noticed a shift in him. He did not talk alot when we where in a group of people on Discord and I stopped getting access to voice channels that I knew they where all in. Finally I asked one of the other guys in the friend group (his IRL bbf) what was going on and got to hear that my ""little brother"" was not comfortable with me in the discord calls. This was a shock to since just a few days ago he laughed and had fun playing games together with me and said that I was his best friend again. When I asked my LB what I had done since I could not figure it out I got no respond. A bit later after some probing from his bbf he finaly answered me and that he did not feel comfortable with me talking about dating and alot of other stuff. Things that he had never mentioned to me he did not want to talk about (sometimes he asked ME about that stuff even). I feel now like I have been lied to for soooo long. He said I could tell him anything, that talking to me always made him feel better from his depression etc. Now it feels like all of that was a lie.

I now stand on the outside of this group of friends that I have been playing with and gotten to know for nearly a year. The others say they will still play with me but I know that is not true since they where his friends first. I know for a fact that if I asked and he was online playing they would always go to him first and I get that, BUT it hurts. I did not even think that it could hurt this much. 

In my derpession over the years I have always felt like a failure since I cannot keep friends. All my friends comes and goes but NONE lasts. Now when this happend it feels like I have been kicked in the stomach and I cannot breathe . The loneliness is pressing down on me like a rock over my chest and all I want to do is sit in a corner, hugging my knees and cry. Why do nobody want to hang out with me? Why do I not have friends that care about me? I care about everybody and I am getting sick of this bullshit of me beeing the one that works to keep the friendship going. I just want to stop feeling so lonely.

So, Reddit, Is there something wrong with me? What do you do when this brick of loneliness hits?

Thank you for letting me vent here.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

889,t3_ynxenb,depression,Life Is Painful In All Aspects and I Feel Alone,"I don't really write posts so much because posting to so many people causes me anxiety, but I've been in a pretty dark place recently. I don't really talk to many people and I don't have many friends, the ones I do have I have felt disconnected with and have been making me feel kind of down too. Not purposely, and I know they don't mean to, but it does happen.

They tell me that I'm an innocent-minded person, which I do know, but they often make me feel down because of it. An example is they were talking about ""water sports"" before, which is a kink thing, and I didn't understand, so when they asked me what I thought of it I said ""I only really like rowing"" and they laughed. I thought it was funny too, but they then go on to make me feel like a child sometimes, one of them even said once ""I can't see him as a man, I just can't, he's a boy to me"" or asking me questions like ""do you know what this or that means"", usually something stupid like ""do you know what a horse's mane is?"" and random questions like that, ones you would ask a 10 year old, and I should say I am almost 28. I know they don't mean to make me feel bad, but sometimes it does make me feel like I'm less of what I should be at my age

My family household is always negative too, they fight and shout at each other every day. They really do hate each other and push each other to the point where they throw things, slam doors, and even cry. I usually stay awake all night to avoid that, but today woke up hearing their shouting after some bad dreams that my dog died. She got diagnosed with an incurable cancer last month and I've been struggling with that as I have a very close bond with her

I went out with her yesterday to a new place because I knew she would enjoy it, but it do cause me some anxiety as I have agoraphobia, but I wanted to take her all the time. It just feels like every aspect of my life is hurting me right now. With my family it is a horrible and hateful atmosphere, with my friends I feel like I'm an idiot, and with my dog I know I will soon lose her. I feel very much alone and it was a struggle to even get out of bed today",1.0,3.0,0.0,3.0

I'm starting to get irritated and hate everything around me. I don't smoke or drink but I'm starting to think i should if it makes me feel better. My friends only care about themselves and proving themselves right no matter what happens and it infuriates me to the core . I'm stressing about my career and feeling suicidal but my friends think it's an exaggeration on my part. I've lost my appetite, everytime I eat i feel I'll just puke it out. I've had panic attacks in the last fews days and I've been crying my eyes out but i can't tell it to anyone because I'm man and I'm supposed to toughen myself up. People see the outside ,the fake smiles and showy lifestyle but don't dare look deep enough to understand if I'm okay or not. I didn't tell my parents what's going on with me because I don't wanna worry but i don't know what i should do to feel better . I don't have girlfriend and the few people I'm really close to are often busy .",1.0,2.0,0.0,2.0
